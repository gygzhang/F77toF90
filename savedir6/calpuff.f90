! --- Version 7.3.0, Level 150915 to Version 7.3.1, Level 171103
!     1) When reading AERMOD or CTDM PROFILE.DAT files, fill missing
!        levels.  This will avoid calculations in numerical rise 
!        for PRIME from using missing data flags.  After fills all
!        will be complete for temperature, WS, WD and Scalar WS.
!        Issue arises when multi-level on-site data is used in AERMET
!        and levels are not complete for all variables.  For instance
!        records are present for 2 meter temperature and 10 meter winds.
!        MODIFIED: RDMET4, RDMET5
!     2) Modified reads for AERMOD and CTDM PROFILE.DAT to identify 
!        multi-level profiles where all records are CALM.  Previously
!        CALM profiles were only properly identified for cases with
!        only 1 layer.
!        Issue and Fix contributed by Eric Delisle, SNC-Lavalin 
!        MODIFIED: RDMET4, RDMET5
!     3) Corrected referencing to nlines (previously nln1) for number
!        of lines in input control file when associating scaling factors
!        with specific sources.  (contributed by Gianluca Antonacci)

! --- TNG-7.0.0, Level 140913 to TNG-7.1.0, Level 141230
!     1) Add road-source time-varying data file RDEMARB.DAT option

!     9) Bug-fix:  add check for Gaussian vertical distribution before
!        calling RISEWIND to refine advection wind (may cause halt in
!        ADVECT subroutine)
!        MODIFIED: COMP
!    10) Add BID to sigmas for the PRIME case where plume does
!        not enter the wake (no wake table).  Plume growth is
!        calculated from the source rather than from the sigmas at the
!        end of the wake (read from the wake table, including BID),
!        so the BID due to rise must be added.  Before this fix the BID
!        sigmas were set to zero like the plumes that enter the wake,
!        and this can over-estimate concentrations.
!        Earlier CALPUFF versions (before Version 6.268, Level 100308)
!        did not include BID in the wake tables, so BID was always
!        added in subsequent calculations including this case without
!        a wake table.
!        Apply partial penetration option to PRIME downwash plumes
!        ONLY when plume does NOT enter wake (the penetrated mass
!        variables fmix and hmax had been calculated without downwash,
!        but the final plume height with downwash had not been altered)
!        MODIFIED: POINTS1, POINTS2
!    11) Adjust final rise with ISC downwash when using partial
!        penetration and/or wind shear options
!        MODIFIED: POINTS1, POINTS2, GRISE
!    12) Bug-fix:  rename loop index in debug output that conflicted
!        with calling argument.  Could cause model to stop if debug
!        output is selected with more than 1 variable-emissions file
!        for point sources.  Contributed by Peter Rye.

!        
! --- Version 6.42, Level 110325 to Version TNG-7.0.0, Level 140913
!     1) Add new input groups in the control file for FLARES and ROADS,
!        so the control file dataset is changed to TNG-3.0
!     2) Treat FLARE sources as a discrete source type throughout code
!        rather than as a subset of POINTS (introduced in v6.42_x1.0)
!        NOTES: 1. This implementation allows for flare source data to
!                  be provided in one or more FLEMARB.DAT files.
!                  It does not allow for inputs to the control file.
!               2. Although the FLEMARB.DAT file format allows a
!                  non-vertical exit velocity, this is not fully
!                  implemented and so is not currently supported.
!               3. The FLEMARB.DAT file format allows either the
!                  buoyancy and momentum fluxes or the exit temperature
!                  and velocities to be used, but the fluxes are not
!                  currently supported.
!               4. The flare source is similar to the point source
!                  except that its location is updated each timestep as
!                  the flame tip moves with the wind direction.  This
!                  precludes building downwash.

!     3) Add ROAD source type, and implement for control-file input.

!     4) Update output file formats to Dataset Version TNG-3.0:
!        Remove control-file option IOVERS that allowed either
!        dataset 2.1 or 2.2 output to be selected.
!        If IOVERS is present, a warning is written that the output
!        files are Dataset TNG-3.0.
!         - Dynamically set number of source-types
!         - Add receptor pole heights to discrete receptor output
!         - Add receptor group names
!        MODIFIED: BLOCK DATA, READCF, QAINP, WROUT1
!     5) Update header format of output binary PFTRAK.DAT file to
!        Dataset Version TNG-3.0 with additional time and space
!        information and the structure for additional source types
!        (add flares and roads)

!        source types (add flares and roads)
!        MODIFIED: WROUT1
!     7) Fix bug in setting the high and low limits on the range of
!        receptors that are within the range of influence of a SLUG
!        during a sampling step.  A typo in screening for the impact
!        zone about the youngest end of the slug at the end of the step
!        used its position at the start of the step with its spread at
!        the end of the step.

!        or distance measured from this point rather than interpolating
!        sigmas via virtual time (distance) at the start and end of the
!        sampling step.  This assures that the sigmas are continuous in
!        this region.  This applies to puff steps that start within the
!        wake.  Subsequent steps interpolate the virtuals.
!        Modified: PUFRECS
!     2) Reinstate use of tabulated sigmas and the corresponding virtual
!        distance/time when setting initial puff properties within the
!        PRIME wake region.  Update (1) allows modifications made in
!        v6.2 (5) to be reactivated.

!     3) Trap negative virtuals when computing source sigma that
!        grows to wake-modified sigma at end of wake, and set to zero

!     4) Fix timestep provided to INJECT call for the cavity source for
!        point sources with PRIME downwash when PTEMARB emissions are
!        used for variable emissions.  The incorrect variable named was
!        not assigned a value, leading to zero emissions from the

!        Modified: POINTS2
!     5) Align calculation of plume drdx in wake region with ISC-PRIME.
!        The drdx includes extra dilution in the wake and this is then
!        used in the numerical rise, so the resolution of tabulated
!        values can alter rise and mass captured in the cavity.
!        Implement by creating XWAKISC() and DRWAKISC() arrays.  Since
!        these are only used in NUMRISE for the current source, they
!        are not saved to the SRCTAB file.

!
!     1) Relax test for small negative travel in SIGTZ following the

!        interpreted as zero, but larger negative travel indicates a
!        potential problem and the code should halt as it does now.
!        Configuration for both SIGTY and SIGTZ:
!          0.00s >dt> -.01s    dt reset to zero (incident not reported)

!          -1.0m >dx           CALPUFF Halted with error message
!        Incidents counted are reported to the list file at the end of
!        the run with the most negative travel encountered.
!        Modified: WARN, SIGTZ, SIGTY, FIN
!     2) Align method of computing sigmas in building wake to that
!        used in ISC-PRIME.  Include BID in sigmas at the entry to
!        the wake (xi) and allow these enhanced sigmas to grow within the
!        wake PDF region.  Tabulated sigmas for PRIME sources will now
!        include the BID so that BID in the puff arrays must be set to
!        zero. Previous method grew sigmas in the wake without BID, and
!        tabulated sigmas from the source to the end of the wake without
!        BID.  Non-zero BID was then added whenever a sigma was
!        extracted from the table.  Also removed is an approximate
!        calculation of the BID-enhanced sigmas that was used when the
!        BID term is small compared to the sigma.

!        wake arrays with those used in ISC-PRIME.
!        Modified: NUMPR1, WAKE_DFSN
!     4) Remove use of tabulated sigmas and the corresponding virtual
!        distance/time when setting initial puff properties within the
!        PRIME wake region.  A single virtual distance/time obtained
!        at the donwind end of the wake must be used for a consistent
!        treatment of the transition to the ambient dispersion even
!        though this has the potential to create sigmas within the
!        wake region that do not match those in the tabulations,

!        This removes modifications made in v6.2 (5).
!        Modified: SETPUF
!     5) Fix error in cavity concentrations (factor-of-2 for reflection
!        was missing and impact from the end of the cavity to the end of

!    15) Declare default potential temperature gradient as 1-D real
!        variable instead of implicit scalar.  The 1-D PTG enters via the
!        calling argument list, and is used in subroutine calls that

!        Modified: EXMET
!    18) Met station coordinates assumed for single-station met

!     4) 1/Slug-length is not computed for young end of emitting slugs
!        because it is not defined.  But it is used in clipping logic,
!        so it should be the actual length which equals the result
!        computed for the older end.  Clipping at the release point

!    (4) Add call to SRCTABOUT to update the source number of the

!        processed during the first step.  The source number given
!        to slugs generated from line segments 2+ has '1000' added to

!        The code stopped in the second timestep.  This only affects

!        Modified: COMP
!    (5) Use local source-table arrays in the subroutine used to move
!        the puff index when inactive puffs are removed from DA file
!        of source-related tabulations.  The current contents in the
!        arrays had been overwritten before being used because the
!        /SRCTAB/ common had been included, and the roll-down process
!        happens after the tables are created.  This affects all
!        source types that use tabulated rise information whenever
!        inactive puffs are removed when generating puffs/slugs.
!        Roll-downs made when splitting puffs or when generating a
!        restart file do not overwrite arrays that are currently in use.
!        Modified: SWAPTAB
!    (6) Do not allow the receptor-specific sigmas for a line source
!        to be zero.  Add a check for sy0 and sz0 when puffs/slugs are

!    (7) Add check for zero final rise from a buoyant line source when
!        computing receptor-specific sigmas for the case of an emitting

!
! --- Version 6.261, Level 080520 to Version 6.262, Level 080725
!
!     1) Modified check for invalid gradual rise factor that halted
!        a valid run in which the final plume rise was nearly zero
!        and the gradual rise was slightly negative due to precision.
!        A zero rise factor should result.  This change does not alter

!
!    (1) Revise variable sampling configuration subroutine to align

!        sampling step length for steady emissions for all steps
!        between the emitting step and the final sampling step of the
!        timestep.  The number of the starting step increases as puffs
!        are released, while the total number of sampling steps is
!        steady.
!        Modified:  COMP, VARSAM
!    (2) Revise test for allowing sampling substeps (LSUBSAM) from 
!        nsam.EQ.mxsam to nsam.GE.mxsam because NSAM is limited by MXNEW
!        during the emitting timestep, and MXNEW might be greater than
!        MXSAM.  The default is MNEW=MXSAM=99 so most applications are
!        not altered by this revision.
!        Modified:  COMP
!    (3) Change the warning response to sources located beyond the
!        computational grid to a fatal response (model stops).  Sources
!        in the PTEMARB and BAEMARB variable emissions files were tested
!        and warnings were written to the list file whenever a source
!        was off of the grid.  Now, all sources must be on the grid, or
!        the run is halted.

!
! --- Version 6.23, Level 080204 to Version 6.24, Level 080208
!
!    (1) Introduce control file switch MPARTLBA to toggle application
!        of the partial penetration option MPARTL to buoyant area
!        sources. This allows these sources to be modeled without
!        partial penetration as was done in the concurrent version 5

!        Modified:  FLAGS.PUF
!                   BLOCK DATA, READCF, QAINP, AREAS2

!        sampling step duration rather than the computed step when
!        these two times are equal to within the precision of stored
!        real numbers.  This allows hourly variable emissions files to

!    (1) Refine mixing height adjustment of the top of the layer
!        containing a target height in PUFFDZ so that the layer-top
!        returned is always greater than the target height.
!        Add checks for a layer top less than a layer bottom to routines
!        that define or use layer interfaces to obtain mean winds.
!        Modified:  PUFFDZ, ADVECT
!    (2) Trap case of falling puff in the RISEWIND procedure because it
!        may lead to the 'bottom' of the layer exceeding the 'top' of
!        the layer used to obtain the mean advection during rise.
!        Modified:  RISEWIND
!    (3) RISEWIND samples winds across the current gradual rise path
!        via calls to GRISE.  However, GRISE does not include stack-tip
!        downwash and RISEWIND does not apply it either.  Add the tip
!        downwash adjustment to GRISE and remove the adjustment

!
! --- Version 6.21, Level 070801 to Version 6.22, Level 070921
!
!    (1) When performing cavity sampling for PRIME downwash, restrict
!        primary source calculations to receptors downwind of primary
!        source and add screen for receptors located far to the side
!        (no impact).  Without this restriction, the model may halt with
!        an attempted division by zero.  Receptors upwind of the source
!        are processed for cavity impacts starting with Version 5.8,
!        Level 070629.  Remove unused CAV_SRC.
!        Modified:  CAV_SAMP
!    (2) Add source tabulations stored for previous met periods, and
!        introduce dataset name and version record to RESTART file.
!        This currently applies only to line sources, which use rise
!        tables for the current and previous met periods (MXMETSAV=2).
!        Without the table for the previous met period in a restart
!        file, table values starting as zero may be accessed and
!        halt the run with a divide-by-zero.
!        Enforce MXMETSAV=2 as LN1 and LN2 arrays are explicitly
!        dimensioned to 2, and add checks for the met period pointer
!        to trap IMET<1 (should never happen).

!        output index pointers (created problem only for variable line
!        sources with more than 1 emission step per model timestep).
!        Fix bug in RDEM2 argument list that used the undefined variable
!        name NSRC2 instead of NPT2.  This is used to declare arrays
!        that are passed through RDEM2, but this bug does not affect
!        reading data correctly in RDEM2.
!        Modified:  INITPUF
!    (4) Fix bug in wet flux calculation for sampling puffs (not slugs).
!        The horizontal sampling factors were calculated only if puff
!        mass diffused to the surface producing non-zero concentrations.
!        These factors are needed for the wet fluxes due to elevated
!        puffs as well.  Wet removal mass depletion calculations are
!        correct, as are wet fluxes at receptors with non-zero

!    (6) Impose explicit upper limit (MXSAM) on number of sampling steps
!        for variable emissions sources.  Without this clamp, number of
!        sampling steps for each puff emitted can exceed the limit
!        imposed on constant sources described within the control file,

!    (7) Volume sources with variable emissions file:  Revise MVOLUME
!        if-loop error traps and set TMTOTB variable needed in VARSAM
!        to properly compute the number of sampling steps to take in
!        the portion of the timestep after a puff is released.  TMTOTB
!        had been initialized to zero, which resulted in new puffs
!        moving only the emission timestep during the first time step.
!        Modified:  VOLS
!    (8) Add check for ATAN2(0.0,0.0) in FOGREC, as function will halt
!        execution if both arguments are zero.  This behavior changed
!        between F77 and F95 compilations.
!        Modified:  FOGREC
!    (9) Replace intrinsic function AMIN0() with MIN() when both result
!        and arguments are integers (no change in results)
!        Modified:  POINTS2, AREAS2, LINES2, VOLS
!   (10) Fix several undefined variable bugs that do not affect results:
!        - Call to RDEM5 from RDEMSRC uses LPRT in place of LDB
!        - PROBLEM variable initialized to false in LN2FILL
!        - Calm logical is not set in call to VCBAR from DRY, so
!          a frozen puff treatment for dry depletion in calms is
!          never triggered.  This would have made a single calculation
!          of the vertical distribution at the middle of the step in
!          place of 3 calculations during a step.  Logical is explicitly
!          set to false to ensure current 3-step calculation is always
!          done.
!        - Initialize ISTA=ILQ=IPRECIP=0 in WET for debug output
!          (they may not be computed)
!        - Change J to I in debug output in VOLS, AREAS1/2

! --- Version 6.2, Level 070629 to Version 6.21, Level 070801
!
!    (1) Add cap on sigma-z to avoid a floating-point error when
!        computing virtuals.  Default cap is 5e06 m (5000km), which is
!        expected to have no influence on normal concentrations.
!        Modified:  COMPARM.PUF
!                   BLOCK DATA, READCF, COMP
!    (2) Relax requirement that the input restart file be from the same
!        version and level of the code to a WARNING.
!        Modified:  RESTARTQ
!
! --- Version 6.116, Level 070404 to Version 6.2, Level 070629
!
!    (1) Add (MREG) regulatory constraint that overwater and over land
!        minimum sigma-v values must be 0.5 m/s
!        Modified:  QAINP
!    (2) Always write the control file variables to the list file to
!        confirm values used
!        Modified:  READCF
!    (3) Address problem in PRIME downwash when a cavity source puff
!        reaches a "calm" zone in the wake region.  Downwash algorithms
!        were turned off once such a puff was sampled at a receptor.
!        This should be done as soon as such a puff is advected into a
!        calm region so that the puff growth and trajectory remain
!        independent of the sampling receptors.  Move the re-assignment
!        from PUFRECS/SLGRECS to SETPUF/SETSLG.
!        Modified:  SETPUF, SETSLG, PUFRECS, SLGRECS
!    (4) Pass CALM processing result (LCALM) from SETPUF/SETSLG for use
!        later in calls to PUFRECS/SLGRECS.  Previously determined CALM
!        setting was made at the start of a sampling sub-step and may
!        not be current.
!        Modified:  COMP, SETPUF, SETSLG
!    (5) Puff virtual times at the time of release obtained for
!        PRIME downwash during very strong wind speed shear in the
!        vertical can lead to much larger or much smaller sigmas than
!        those tabulated within the wake zone, if time-based disperision
!        rates are selected.  Although the tabulated PRIME sigmas are
!        used for concentrations at receptors in the wake zone, the
!        lateral sampling screen uses the virtual-time sigmas.  This can
!        lead to screening out receptors in the wake zone that should be
!        sampled.  Assign sigmas to the puff in the wake zone from the
!        PRIME sigma tables, and compute the corresponding virtual times.
!        Modified:  SETPUF
!    (6) Initialize the following variables (results are not affected
!        but execution may halt with some compilers)
!          IGRDVL = 0  (READCF)
!          HB, HW, HEFF2, ZLY, RINIT = 0. (POINTS1, POINTS2)
!          YKDUM, SYDUM, ZKDUM, SZDUM = 0.0 (WAKE_DFSN)
!          DBDUW = 0.0  (WAKE_DBG)
!          XMAX, FZMAX = 0.0 (WAKE_FQC)
!          DZDS=0.0 (NUMRISE)
!        Modified:  READCF, POINTS1, POINTS2, WAKE_DFSN, WAKE_DBG,
!                   WAKE_FQC, NUMRISE
!    (7) Assign PTGRAD value to default so it is always available for
!        debug output even when not used (does not change results)
!        Modified:  NUMMET
!    (8) Typo in argument IRU (0=rural, 1=urban) in call to WAKE_INI
!        results in rural dispersion curves in PRIME calculations when
!        making the wake-zone sigma tables (PG dispersion option) if
!        the compiler initializes variables to zero.  Without such
!        initialization, run may halt with invalid IRU value.
!        Modified:  POINTS1, POINTS2
!    (9) Local receptor height ZRC for PRIME cavity-source impact was
!        not set in the wake downwind of the cavity.  Applications that
!        place receptors on the ground are not affected because ZRC is
!        always zero.  (ZRC is set to zero for receptors in the cavity,
!        and it is set to the receptor elevation above the top of the
!        cavity for any receptors placed above a cavity.)  Initialize
!        ZRC to the actual receptor height above the ground.
!        Modified:  CAV_SAMP
!   (10) Cavity concentrations were not computed at receptors in cavity
!        if they were upwind of the source.  Logic updated to account
!        for mass recirculating in cavity.
!        Modified:  CAV_CONC
!   (11) PRIME cavity concentrations are calculated but not reported due
!        to array initializations introduced for the source contribution 
!        option in V5.72.  The cavity concentrations are now placed in
!        the TOTAL concentration arrays which are not zeroed in the
!        source loop, and the source contribution output option is not
!        allowed with the PRIME downwash option.
!        Modified:  QAINP, COMP, CAV_CONC
!   (12) RDHDAQ Typos: call to YR4 for Ozone dataset version 1.5a left
!        header years undefined (or zero);  call to RDHDAQ from CHEMI
!        used LPRT instead of LDB, so header info was not written
!        Modified:  CHEMI, RDHDAQ
!   (13) Recast SMXI2 in calculation of NSAM to match numerical
!        represention obtained in Version 5
!        Modified:  COMP
!
! --- Version 6.115, Level 061020 to Version 6.116, Level 070404
!
!    (1) Modify test of header of restart file to read just the first 
!        variable.  This avoids the possibility of attempting to read
!        past the end of the first record, causing the program to halt.
!        Modified:  FILVERS
!    (2) CALUTILS from v2.54 Level 061020 to v2.55 Level 070327
!        Fixed format bug in subroutine BASRUTC for the case of
!        time zone zero (output string was 'UTC+0  0' instead of
!        'UTC+0000'
!        Modified:  UTCBASR, BASRUTC
!    (3) COORDLIB from v1.97 Level 060626 to v1.98 Level 060911
!        Changes in COORDS that allow a higher level of FORTRAN error
!        checking.  Compiler checks had identified constant arguments
!        and 2 uninitialized variables.  None of these is known to
!        have produced errors in cooerdinate conversions.
!        Modified:  COORDS
!
! --- Version 6.114, Level 060725 to Version 6.115, Level 061020
!
!    (1) Screen discrete receptors for any locations that are not 
!        within the computational grid
!        Modified:  QAINP
!    (2) CALUTILS from v2.52 Level 060519 to v2.54 Level 061020
!        Move GLOBE1 to COORDLIB;
!        Allow negative increments in INCRS

!    (3) COORDLIB from v1.95 Level 050126 to v1.97 Level 060626
!        Add Albers Conical Equal Area projection
!        Add GLOBE1 (from CALUTILS)
!
! --- Version 6.113, Level 060519 to Version 6.114, Level 060725
!
!    (1) Restart file option fails due to typo in naming variables and
!        also assigning old value of data format flag MTVER.
!        These changes were identified by: Peter D�Abreton
!        Modified:  RESTARTI
!    (2) Fix PTLAPS case where upper height of layer for extracting
!        the potential temperature gradient exceeds the middle of the 
!        top layer of the model (search index was not assigned in this
!        case which leads to an invalid array index)
!        Contributed by:  Bart Brashers, Geomatrix Consultants
!        Modified:  PTLAPS
!    (3) Ozone.dat dataset version 2.1 header is processed for LL, LCC,
!        and UTM map projections, but not others.  Add PS,EM,LAZA,TTM.
!        Modified:  RDHDAQ
!
! --- Version 6.112, Level 060412 to Version 6.113, Level 060519
!
!    (1) CALUTILS from v2.51 Level 051019 to v2.52 Level 060519
!        Variable names in control file are not processed correctly
!        if there are too many characters (including blanks) to the
!        left of the "=" sign (run stops in setup phase).
!        Modified:  READIN
!
! --- Version 6.111, Level 060329 to Version 6.112, Level 060412
!
!    (1) Remove check on time in METQA that improperly stopped run
!        with multiple CALMET files, and add screen message to
!        time-check in RDMET
!        Modified:  METQA, RDMET

!
!    (1) COORDLIB from v1.95 Level 050126 to v1.96 Level 051010
!    (2) CALUTILS from v2.5 Level 041123 to v2.51 Level 051019
!    (3) Filnames changed from c*70 to c*132 (for CALUTILS V2.3
!        and later)
!        Modified:  FILNAM.PUF
!                   READFN, WRFILES, FILVERS, OPENAB
!    (4) Changed LDBG to .FALSE. to remove debug output to list file
!        when SLUG option is used
!        Modified:  RECSPEC0
!    (5) Correct bugs in QAINP that did not properly identify the EPA
!        guidance selections when checking user inputs:
!         -- Allow either CALMET or ISCMET (METFM=1,2)
!         -- Allow either MESOPUFF II of RIVAD chemistry (MCHEM=1,3)
!         -- Allow either PG or turbulence-based dispersion (MDISP=2,3)
!         -- Require PDF option with turbulence-based dispersion
!        Modified: QAINP
!    (6) Screen call to TIBLGRO using heat flux at start of step, as
!        calculated from u-star and M-O length, to conform to what is
!        done within TIBLGRO.  The heat flux had been computed for the
!        mid-point of the step, which can lead to a run-time error.
!        Test for small/negative heat flux during step in TIBLGRO.
!        Modified: COMP, TIBLGRO
!    (7) Add minimum Sigma-v and Sigma-w inputs for overwater cells as

!
!
! --- Version 6.101, Level 051020 to Version 6.102, Level 051130
!
!    (1) Revise header information for Air Quality files (e.g., 
!        OZONE.DAT) that have coordinates specified in Lat/Lon to
!        remove the LLORDER string.  These files require the order
!        to be (lat,lon), and values include N/S or E/W explicitly
!        so that the model will stop with an error message if the
!        order is not correct.  Also, fix bug in reading the UTM zone
!        and hemispere.
!        Modified: RDHDAQ, RDTIAQ, CHEMI
!
!    (2) Add QA plot output files for OZONE and H2O2 stations

!
! --- Version 6.1, Level 050915 to Version 6.101, Level 051020
!
!    (1) Fix bug in skipping LNEMARB header records, and in assigning
!        current emissions time to buoyant line source arrays
!        Modified: SKIPHDEM5, INITPUF
!
!    (2) Modify WET to output XLAM as the scavenging RATIO rather
!        than the scavenging COEFFICIENT.  This bug caused all non-zero
!        wet fluxes for SLUGs to be based on a 1 mm/hr precipitation
!        rate.  Concentrations and dry fluxes are not affected.  This
!        bug does not affect any PUFF results.
!        Modified: WET
!
! --- Version 5.751, Level 050805 to Version 6.1, Level 050915
!
!    (1) Update date-time used throughout code to reference time
!        intervals by begin-time / end-time pairs in place of just
!        the end-time, and include seconds
!
!    (2) Update variable point and area emissions files to allow
!        variations down to the second (old file formats supported)
!
!    (3) Update variable line and volume emissions files to allow
!        variations down to the second (old file formats supported)
!
!    (4) Update met data files to allow update steps as short as 1
!        second (chemistry time-of-day functions are not updated)
!
! ?? (5) Add emissivity for numerical rise (EPSRAD) to control file
!
!    (6) Add emission-step index to puff arrays in /PUFF/
!        Modified: PUFF.PUF
!                  SWAP, RESTARTI, RESTARTO
!
!    (7) Force the output averaging period to be the model timestep
!        period (source contribution loop structure precludes averaging
!        across timesteps) --- STOP run if the timestep exceeds the
!        meteorological update step.
!
! --- Version 5.75, Level 050225 to Version 5.751, Level 050805
!
!    (1) Add check in trajectory/coastline intercept (onshore flow)
!        calculation for parallel lines (equal slope).  The vector
!        cross-product (previous check) should be zero when the slopes
!        are equal, but precision can lead to a slightly positive
!        cross-product.  Identical slopes produces divide-by-zero.
!        Modified: TIBLON
!
!    (2) Place water cell mixing height (not ht0) into TIBL array
!        locations upwind of the coast, and use land cell pointer in
!        call to TIBLGRO so that shore properties are consistent with
!        coastline as puff crosses coast
!        Modified: TIBLGRO, TIBLON, COMP
!
!    (3) Add turbulence advection option for including advection
!        effects with decay to modify the local sigma-v and sigma-w
!        for puff growth (MDISP=2) --- Draft implementation for
!        testing

!
!    (1) Add building downwash adjustment for elevated (platform)
!        structures with an open area between the surface and the bulk
!        of the structures.  Currently implemented for ISC downwash
!        method (MBDW = 1).

!        - increasing the ratio of sigma-z to zmix at which the 
!          well-mixed puff flag is set (subr. VMASS)

!                    from Version 5.722, Level 040610 
!                    to   Version 5.727, Level 050309 
!
!
!    (1) Drop the requirement that the UTM zone in the OZONE.DAT file
!        matches the UTM zone in the CALPUFF control file when the UTM
!        projection is NOT used.  Instead, require that the zone be
!        zero in the header of OZONE.DAT (when present).
!        Modified: CHEMI
!
!    (2) Replace restriction that Boundary Condition (BC) segments must
!        match the computational grid cell size with a warning that
!        they do not match, and allow the BC segments to be larger than
!        the grid cell size (but not smaller).
!        Modified: RDHDBC
!
!    (3) Fix bug in GRISE associated with the rise factor for the PRIME
!        module.  The rise factor used to adjust the buoyancy-induced
!        dispersion from that at final rise to that at a gradual rise
!        height should exclude streamline deflections induced by the
!        building.  The gradual rise (without streamline deflection) was
!        divided by the final rise (with streamline deflection).  This
!        may cause any buoyancy-induced dispersion to be overestimated
!        in the gradual rise region, when using the PRIME option,
!        leading to larger puff sigmas.  Receptors located beyond the
!        distance to final rise are not affected.
!        Modified: GRISE
!
!    (4) Fix bug in PUFRECS that did not update the rise factor when the
!        PRIME wake tables are used to obtain receptor-specific sigmas.
!        The rise factor is used after the PUFRECS call to adjust
!        the sigmas for the PDF option.  This may cause a runtime
!        error that halts an application.  Concentrations are affected
!        at receptors withing a building wake during daytime periods
!        only if both the PRIME and PDF options are used.
!        Modified: PUFRECS
!
!    (5) COORDLIB updated to stop UTM conversions with a DATUM that is
!        not mapped to the list in the USGS UTM subroutine.  An example
!        is the sphere datum NWS-84 (Earth radius 6370km), since only
!        the sphere datum ESR-S (Earth radius 6371km) is available.
!        Unmapped datums had defaulted to the Clarke 1866 spheroid.
!        LAZA Projection:  removed assignment of 6370 km earth
!        radius (NWS-84 datum) when a value less than 6000 km is
!        found.  This assignment can override a requested radius
!        of 6371 (ESR-S datum) if the NWS-84 datum is used with
!        any valid projection prior to the request for ESR-S.
!        LAZA(NWS-84) coordinate distances from the projection
!        origin are about 0.016% smaller than LAZA(ESR-S).
!        Error message and version strings added to COORDS calls
!        and new subroutine COORDSVER to report COORDS version
!        documentation.
!        (Version 1.95, Level 050126)
!        COORDLIB updated to fix UTM conversion in the S.
!        hemisphere when the ouput UTM zone is forced as N. 
!        hemisphere, and the DATUM changes (completes changes
!        started in version 1.93).
!        (Version: 1.94, Level: 041007)
!
!    (6) Added call to COORDSVER to access the COORDS version info and
!        passed string to list file and comment section of output files.
!        Modified: READCF, WROUT1
!
!    (7) LUSE.CLR color scale file modified to better distinguish
!        wetlands, and a RED strip is added at the top of the bar for
!        a marker LU of 99.
!        Modified: QAPLOT1
!
!    (8) Added new files TK2D.DAT and RHO2D.DAT along with the output
!        control variables IT2D and IRHO respectively.  This complements
!        the VISB.DAT output file of 2D Relative Humidity
!        fields with the corresponding 2D Temperature and Density fields
!        written in the same file format.

!        last argument PROBLEM had been omitted.
!        Modified: RDEMSRC
!
!   (10) Initialize first element of MXNW numerical rise arrays to stack
!        conditions to avoid problems with an old NN index being used.
!        This could affect buoyant area sources and point sources with
!        the PRIME downwash option when these sources are non-buoyant
!        and are given very small (but non-zero) exit velocity.
!        Modified: NUMRISE
!
!   (11) Add test for a zero lofting rise in PDFPATH to avoid potential
!        attempt to divide by zero.
!        Modified: PDFPATH
!                    
!   (12) Change the GRD file format for SURFER Image files (QALUSE.GRD)
!        This applies to GRD files that are plotted as image maps (not
!        contours) -- Landuse.  SURFER 7 required a range
!        adjustment to properly register the grid cell blocks that
!        make up the image.  SURFER 8 registers cells properly without
!        the adjustment, so the standard GRD works for both image and
!        contour maps.  The revised output follows the SURFER 8
!        convention in which all GRD files are alike.
!        (We presume that the SURFER 7 format will seldom be needed.)

!   (13) Enlarge output format for the QATERR.DAT plot-file to allow
!        terrain heights below sea level (subroutine QAPLOT1).
!
! --- Version 5.74, Level 040715 to Version 5.741, Level 040913
!
!    (1) Fix bug in XERFDIF that produced an error in integral F1.
!        The F1 integral in the analytic sampling done for attached
!        slugs is not coded correctly.  F1 is used only for slugs as
!        they are being emitted (youngest end is at the source), and 
!        is multiplied by the change in effective emission rate during 
!        the sampling step (due to chemical transformation or
!        deposition removal).
!
!    (2) Add stop in QAINP if DATUM in control file is UNKNOWN
!
!    (3) COORDLIB updated to respond to UTM conversion across the
!        equator from S. hemisphere to N. hemisphere, when the S.
!        hemisphere zone is forced.  Also fixed a problem with the
!        conversion to/from spherical NWS-84 datum when using UTM
!        projection (USGS program input array conflicts).
!        (Version: 1.93, Level: 040713)
!
!    (4) Add puff-age cutoff control MXAGEHR (hours) in Group 12.
!        Puffs older than MXAGEHR (>0) are de-activated.
!        Feature typically NOT appropriate for Regulatory applications!
!        Modified COMPARM.PUF
!                 BLOCK DATA, READCF, QAINP, COMP
!
!    (5) Change the control parameter MGRAV to MTILT, and augment the
!        "tilted plume" calulations by:
!        - increasing the ratio of sigma-z to zmix at which the 
!          well-mixed puff flag is set (subr. VMASS)
!
! --- Version 5.73, Level 040611 to Version 5.74, Level 040715
!
!    (1) Add AERMET version of SURFACE and PROFILE met data files
!        Modified FLAGS.PUF, GEN.PUF
!                 BLOCK DATA, READCF, QAINP, COMP, ADVECT, WINDSET,
!                 POINTS1, POINTS2, LINES1, LINES2, AREAS2, NUMPR1,
!                 NUMMET, WRFILES, SETUP, OPENOT, PTLAPS
!        New      RDMET5, RDPROF5
!                 
!
! --- Version 5.722, Level 040610 to Version 5.73, Level 040611
!
!    (1) Add gravitational settling (plume-tilt) option to allow
!        puffs with 1 particle species to fall at the gravitational
!        settling velocity for that species.  Restrictions:
!        - MGRAV = 1  Turns option on (new variable)
!        - NSPEC = 1  (must be particle species as well)
!        - sg    = 0  GEOMETRIC STANDARD DEVIATION in Group 8 is
!                     set to zero to make single particle diameter
!        - MCTADJ= 0,1,3  (Interaction with option 2 not supported)
!        Modified FLAGS.PUF, CURRENT.PUF
!                 BLOCK DATA, READCF, QAINP, VCBAR
!                 SETPUF, PUFRECS, SETSLG, SLGRECS, RECSPEC0
!
!    (2) Change number of particle sizes name from NINT to NPSINT to
!        avoid overlap with function NINT.
!        Modified DRYPART.PUF, BLOCK DATA, READCF, 
!                 DRYI, VDP, VDP1, VDCOMP
!
! --- Version 5.721, Level 040503 to Version 5.722, Level 040610
!
!    (1) Fix array assignments in RESTART subroutines by using the
!        /puff/ and /slug/ include files.  Restart option
!        did not work in V5.72+ (QA stopped run).
!
! --- Version 5.72, Level 031017 to Version 5.721, Level 040503
!
!    (1) VERY small negative virtual time/distance is reset to ZERO
!        in SIGTY and SIGTZ (PRIME module)
!
!    (2) Added list-file report of largest (most) negative 
!        increments encountered in SIGTY.  New routine WARN added.
!        Modified SIGTY, FIN
!
!    (3) COORDLIB updated to respond to projection parameter
!        changes when both the projection type and datum do not change
!        (Version: 1.92, Level: 031201)
!
!    (4) Fix array declaration in CALCSL:  species mass array for wet
!        deposition declared using mxspec (had been declared nspec).
!        This bug causes erroneous wet fluxes to be output from
!        slug sampling.  Total mass of each species in slugs is not
!        affected.
!
!    (5) File unit passed to subroutine YR4 for listfile output was
!        not defined so that error reports attempted to write to 
!        unit 0.  Changed io1 to io6 in call to YR4 from subroutines
!        RDHDBC2 and GETRCRD.
!
!    (6) Function XVZ altered to improve single precision accuracy
!        of solution for stability classes A and B
!        (NOT connected, revision is called XVZ2)
!
! --- Version 5.713, Level 030905 to Version 5.72, Level 031017
!
!    (1) Fix QA output file for gridded receptors (QARECG.DAT)
!        [incorrect terrain elevations reported]
!        and add control file switch to disable QAPLOT feature
!          - CALPUFF.INP, OUTPT.PUF, BLOCK DATA, READCF, SETUP
!
!    (2) Replace the puff ID (ppptssss) with individual integer arrays
!        to allow for more puffs/source and more sources: IRLSNUM,
!        ISRCNUM, and ISRCTYP repace IPUFID.
!          - PUFF.PUF, COMP, SWAP, RESTARTI, RESTARTO, SPLIT,
!            POINTS1, POINTS2, AREAS1, AREAS2, VOLS,
!            LINES1, LINES2, BCS1, ZTRACE
!
!    (3) Add source contribution output feature.  Output data file
!        format is revised (version 2.1).
!          - CALPUFF.INP, FLAGS.PUF, PARAMS.PUF, CHIFLX.PUF,
!            PT1.PUF, AR1.PUF, LN1.PUF, VOL1.PUF
!          - BLOCK DATA, READCF, QAINP, SETUP, COMP, OPENOT,
!            OUTPUT, WROUT1
!          - RDEMSRC, TCHIFLX
!
!    (4) Change control file source names from character*12 to
!        character*16 to match string length used in variable emission
!        files.
!
!    (5) WGS-72 DATUM bug for UTM calls fixed in COORDLIB
!        (Version: 1.91, Level: 031017) 
!
! --- Version 5.712, Level 030822 to Version 5.713, Level 030905
!
!    (1) DATUMs updated in COORDLIB (Version: 1.9, Level: 030905)
!    (2) Default DATUMs reset
!
! --- Version 5.711, Level 030625 to Version 5.712, Level 030822
!
!    (1) Address PRIME module bug that produced a negative virtual
!        travel time increment due to numerical precision (seen when
!        using turbulence-based sigma option with PRIME downwash)
!        Modified:  WAKE_DFSN
!
! --- Version 5.71, Level 030528 to Version 5.711, Level 030625
!
!    (1) Address TIBL module bug that left cell index (i,j) undefined
!        Modified:  TIBLGRO
!
! --- Version 5.7, Level 030402 to Version 5.71, Level 030528
!
!    (1) Assign inputs for LCC projection to internal variables used
!        in QA checks
!
!    (2) Remove old UTM zone check in METQA that does not screen out
!        PMAP.NE.UTM cases
!
!    (3) Add MBCON=2 option to read a CONC.DAT file from another
!        CALPUFF run and use receptor concentrations as boundary
!        condition
!        New:       HEADBC2.PUF
!                   RDHDBC2, BC2DOC, RDEMBC2, GETRCRD, UNCOMPRS
!        Modified:  BCS.PUF, FLAGS.PUF
!                   SETUP, OPENOT, RDHDBC, INITPUF
!
!    (4) Fix xmesh,ymesh definition for computing MBCON=1 segment
!        grid coordinates (mesh becomes 1/mesh)
!
!    (5) Add Input Group 12 variables for MBCON option to configure
!        the BC puff depth, the search radius for identifying BC
!        impacts, and a switch to control the near-surface depletion
!        adjustment for the BC puffs.
!        Modified:  BCS.PUF
!                   READCF, BLOCK DATA, BCS1, CALCBC, COMP,
!                   RDHDBC, RDHDBC2
!
!    (6) Add QA checks for MBCON configuration and write QA ALERT
!        notice to screen (QAINP); require that species 'BCON' be
!        modeled when MBCON > 0.  Boundary puffs will be emitted
!        with non-zero mass of BCON to model clean air the same way
!        as polluted air.
!
!    (7) Update COORDLIB (Version: 1.15  Level: 030528)
!        Update CALUTILS (Version: 2.2  Level: 030528)
!
!    (8) Modify use of MAX function in WAKE_FQC and args of MIN in
!        NUMRISE to conform to compiler type rules
!
!    (9) Trap zero bldg length with MBDW=2 (PRIME) in READCF
!
!   (10) Require non-negative emissions in READCF, INITPUF, LN2FIL

!
!    (1) Accommodate the CALMET no-observation mode, 
!        [Originally denoted as Ver 5.5  Level 010901]  (FRR)
!        Changes to:
!        - COMP, RDMET, EXMET, SUNDATA, GETPRFM, WET
!          AREAS1, VOLS, POINTS1, POINTS2, LINES1, NUMMET, TIBLON
!          TIBLGRO, BCS1, FOGOUT, OUTPUT, WROUT1
!        - METHD (new i2dmet) and METHR (2D arrays)
!        - New subroutine METLATLON: computes latitude and longitude
!          of all CALMET gridpoints
!
!    (2) Updated on 03/31/02  to fix bug in WRDAT
!
!    (3) Added i2dmet in header record for all types of output, 
!        subroutine WROUT1.  
!        [Originally denoted as Ver 5.5  Level 021028]  (FRR)
!
!    (4) Bug fix in RDMET (ipcode2d data was not read when npsta=-1)
!        [Originally denoted as Ver 5.5  Level 030119]  (FRR)
!
!    (5) Accept revised CALMET.DAT 2.0 header format
!
!    (6) Implement CALUTILS packaging (Version: 2.1  Level: 030402)
!
!    (7) Implement the full map projection/datum transformation
!        routines using COORDLIB (Version: 1.14  Level: 030402)
!
!    (8) Move Y2K processing of system date into subroutine DATETM
!        and change rdate from (MM-DD-YY) to (MM-DD-YYYY)
!
!    (9) Change UNDER0 call to generic UNDRFLW, and place compiler-
!        specific implementation routines there
!
!   (10) Alter format of QA plot-file header for SURFER 'bug'
!
!   (11) Screen output from VCOUP with sigma_z ~ '0'
!
!   (12) Dataset version 2.0 header format implemented for output
!        data files with control file images, and /MAP/ variables
!
!   (13) Replace OPENAB with explicit ASCII/BINARY option
!        (Set to ASCII for now --- PTEMARB and VOLEMARB only!)
!
!   (14) Add PRIME downwash modules.
!        Modified: NUMPARM.PUF, PT1.PUF, PT2.PUF, FLAGS.PUF, COMPARM.PUF
!                  BLOCK DATA, SETUP, READCF, RDTIEM2, NUMMET, NUMRISE,
!                  POINTS1, POINTS2, GRISE, PUFRECS, SETPUF,
!                  COMP, CALCPF, PLMFOG
!        New:      WAKEDFSN.PUF, WAKEDAT.PUF,
!                  WAKE_CAV0, WAKE_DBG, WAKE_DFSN, WAKE_DIM, WAKE_DRDX,

!                  NUMGRAD, POSITION, ZSTREAM, INTERTAB, WAKE_TAB
!
!   (15) Add IMET and MXMETSAV to manage source tabulations such as
!        plume rise that are saved over multiple met periods
!        (current.puf, params.puf)
!
!   (16) Set the time to Heffter transition (sigma-y) within SETCSIG
!
!   (17) Revise lower threshold for computing a virtual time/distance
!        from szmin,symin to 0.001m in SIGTY and SIGTZ
!
!   (18) Revise default plume rise-angle criterion for wake effects
!        from 45 degrees to 20 degrees
!
!
! --- Version 5.5, Level 010730 to Version 5.5, Level 010730_1
!
!    (1) Remove conditioning of initial sigmas for control file
!        point sources so that a zero is not reset to symin or
!        szmin (READCF)
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_8 to Version 5.5, Level 010730
!
!    (1) Add IWAT2 to list file output in subr. MET1.
!
!    (2) Revise treatment of sigmas at receptors in the building
!        downwash zone of point sources to properly account for
!        initial sigmas at the source.  The changes made in Version 5.4,
!        Level 000602_2, introduced a sigma that already contained the
!        downwash contribution, resulting in overprediction of the
!        sigmas in the wake (which will typically increase ground-level
!        concentrations in the wake).
!
!    (3) Revise wind-direction-specific building information selection
!        to match that used in ISCST3 (treatment of directions that lie
!        on sector boundaries.)
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_7 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_8
!
!    (1) Fix declaration of character*16 variables in /AR2/, /PT2/,
!        and /VOL2/ ('include' files -- no change to CALPUFF.FOR).
!
!    (2) Add constraint that buoyancy flux (FLUXB) be greater than zero
!        to conditions that must be met for calling partial penetration
!        subroutine (PRFPP) in subroutine POINTS2, which processes the
!        PTEMARB source data file.  This condition was already used
!        in subroutine POINTS1 (control file source data).  A run-time
!        divide-by-zero error stops CALPUFF if PRFPP is called with
!        FLUXB=0.0 (emission temperature LE ambient temperature).
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_6 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_7
!
!    (1) Fix call to READIN in subr. RDVD to allow for more than 5
!        species with user-specified deposition velocities.
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_5 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_6
!
!    (1) Fix call to RDEM3 (data records for BAEMARB.DAT files) to use
!        the file unit number 'io' instead of 'io17', which was removed
!        in CALPUFF 5.4, Level 000602.  File unit io17 (which is zero
!        because it is not defined) is not open so the call to RDEM3
!        generates a runtime error which halts the run.  This affects
!        previous CALPUFF versions starting with version 5.4.
!
!    (2) Change name of LCC longitude stored in /PT2/, /AR2/, /LN2/,
!        and /VOL2/ from '-ELON-' to '-WLON-' to match variable
!        returned from XTRACTLL (variables are not currently used).
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_4 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_5
!
!    (1) Add new 'qaplot' files to facilitate making maps of layout
!        [qaplot1, setup]
!
!    (2) Initialize QAFAIL before MREG if-block in qainp
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_3 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_4
!
!    (1) Remove XLAT,XLONG,XTZ variables from Input Group 4 of control
!        file, and place XBTZ into Input Group 1 [changes to METHD.PUF,
!        DATEHR.PUF, GRID.PUF, block data, readcf, qainp, met1, metqa,
!        sundata]
!
!    (2) Fix ZFRISE assignment before call to RISEWIND and in ZTRACE.
!        The height at final rise was used instead of the rise at
!        final rise.  This has no apparent effect on computations
!        made in these subroutines.
!
!    (3) Screen hourly data in ISC met file for invalid entries [rdisc,
!        qahrisc]
!
!    (4) Add monthly background O3, NH3, and H2O2 arrays
!        [CHEMDAT.PUF, block data, comp, readcf, qainp, chembk]
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_2 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_3
!
!    (1) Add aqueous phase chemistry option (not enabled)
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602_1 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_2
!
!    (1) Revise MFOG=1 (Plume Mode) option to treat multiple sources;
!        actual receptor locations vary with wind direction and
!        impact of plumes from all sources is summed as in receptor
!        mode; range of receptor distances and heights are selected
!        internally
!
!    (2) Revise FOG.DAT structure to remove restriction on number of
!        receptors; add new header to report compression logical in
!        receptor mode
!
!    (3) Add initial sigmas to downwash sigmas in wake of point sources
!
! --- Version 5.4, Level 000602 to Version 5.4, Level 000602_1
!
!    (1) Set LADTFOG=FALSE in block data.  This corrects problem
!        resulting in zero species #2 (usually SO4) concentrations
!        at discrete receptors.  Versions of CALPUFF earlier
!        than 000602 were not affected by the error.  Also, gridded
!        receptor concentrations were not affected in any version.
!
! --- Version 5.3, Level 991222 to Version 5.4, Level 000602
!
!    (1)  Replace VOLEM.DAT structures with new VOLEMARB.DAT structures
!         that include multiple emissions files
!
!    (2)  Use QAFAIL in QAINP when testing MREG option;  Add reference
!         to list-file at all "stop" statements (message to screen)
!
!    (3)  Add message to "stop" statements to identify subroutine where
!         model run is halted, and refer user to list file
!
!    (4)  Add units choice (g/s or g/m**2/s) to header of BAEMARB.DAT
!
!    (5)  Add initial sigmas and vertical momentum flux factor to
!         PTEMARB.DAT
!
!    (6)  Revise puff sampling (vertical) in depletion calculation
!         to match methods used for receptors during calms (VCBAR)
!
!    (7)  Report NMETDAT>MXMETDAT to unit '*' (io6 not yet assigned)
!
!    (8)  Add Horizontal puff splitting option (Block Data, READCF,
!         QAINP, SPLIT)
!
!    (9)  Revise treatment of exponentials in crosswind impact slug
!         sampling (SLUGINT) for receptors at the fringe of a slug
!
!    (10) Add specialized FOG module for use with the fog analysis
!         package of processors designed to evaluate the frequency
!         of fogging/icing events associated with mechanical-draft
!         cooling towers
!
!    (11) Allow multiple emissions files for point and buoyant area
!         sources
!
!    (12) Add new header record to all variable emissions files to
!         document the parameters for the Lambert Conformal map
!         projection
!
!    (13) Add CALMET version number to test for format before
!         Version 5.0 (980304) in MET1, and add window of 950101-980304
!         for level check in SSLATLON.
!
!    (a1/5.3)  Sigma-w data should not be extracted from a SWPRF array
!         when turbulence data are provided in a PLMMET.DAT file,
!         and a PROFILE.DAT file should not be reported to the
!         list file when turbulence data (sigma-theta) in PLMMET.DAT
!         are used.  (Subroutines TURBSET and WRFILES modified.)
!      ** Change suggested by Dennis Hearn, EPA of Victoria, Australia.
!
!    (a2/5.3)  Profile arrays for turbulence data initialized to missing
!         in BLOCK DATA.
!
!    (a3/5.3)  Complete logic to allow turbulence data to be read from
!         PROFILE.DAT when PLMMET.DAT is the primary met file.
!         (Subroutines QAINP, RDPLM, and COMP modified.)
!
!    (b1/5.3)  Add a momentum flux factor (FMFAC) for point sources to
!         simulate the reduction in vertical momentum caused by stack
!         structures (e.g., rain-hats).  Current implementation allows
!         only 0 or 1 for the factor.  (Subroutines POINTS1, POINTS2,
!         READCF, QAINP, PRFIN, STKTIP, PUFRECS, SLGRECS, PLGRECS,
!         BLOCK DATA)
!
!    (b2/5.3)  Fix bug in READCF processing of FMFAC input array for
!         point sources that updated only the value for the first source
!
! --- Version 5.2, Level 991104 to Version 5.3, Level 991222
!
!    (1)  Add boundary flux module (inflow at edge of computational
!         domain).  This brings in a new source type whose puffs are
!         initially mixed (puff code 6).  These are advected with normal
!         transformation/removal, but they do not grow laterally and
!         the (uniform) concentration from just the nearest such puff
!         is summed to obtain the impact at a given receptor.
!
!    (2)  Enable SOA option
!
!    (a1/5.2) Use MIN,MAX in place of MIN1,MAX1 in TIBLGRO, and move
!         in-line format to format statements in TRACK (removes
!         compiler warnings)
!
!    (a2/5.2)  Bug in CHEM: replace PIVOLM with PIVOLU in assigning
!         puff volume for the Upper layer used to compute the mean puff
!         concentration for the call to CHEMTF  (the M denotes the
!         mixed layer puff volume, the U denotes the upper layer
!         puff volume)
!
!    (a3/5.2)  Condition sigma-z ratio R in CTADJ2 to be <= 1.
!
!    (a4/5.2) Logic added to 3 coordinate routines (MAPG2L, LL2UTM,
!        and UTM2LL) to accommodate -180 to +180 longitude boundary
!        -- taken directly from CALMET V5.1 (991104a) --
!
! --- Version 5.0, Level 990228 to Version 5.2, Level 991104
!
!    (a1/5.0) Add capability to read a list of CALMET.DAT filenames and
!         process them in sequence.
!
!    (a2/5.0) Fix runtime /0 in terrain adjustment option 2 for ground
!         level non-buoyant sources.
!
!    (b1/5.0) Add elevated discrete receptors (gridded and CTSG receptors
!         remain on the surface).
!
!    (c1/5.0) Add ability to track mass flux across user-specified
!         boundaries, using puff centers.
!
!    (d1/5.0) Add ability to track mass balance hourly for all species,
!         for the computational domain.
!
!    (d2/5.0) Add IPFDEB variable to input group 5 to identify puff index
!         at which to begin debug output.
!
!    (d3/5.0) Fix argument type for MIN/MAX functions in MFLXCMP, and 
!         assign ZERO/0.0/ in MFLXINI.
!
!    (e1/5.0) Expand search for nearest land and water cells in TIBLSET
!         and fix loop over cells touched in TIBLON.
!
!    (e2/5.0) Add transition from TIBL to inland mixing heights
!
!    (e3/5.0) Recast IXREMN arrays as map to FULL advected species array
!
!    (a1/5.1) Fix coding error in call to SLGRECS in CALCSL (introduced 
!         in (b1/5.0))
!
!    (b1/5.1) Add PGTIME to control file
!
!    (b2/5.1) Incorporate mmodel='AUSPUFF' options (except metric tons).
!
!    (1) Allow zero exit velocity in numerical rise (rise = 0)
!                                                             <990729>
!
!    (2) Use plume w-velocity < 0 rather than plume angle (phi<0)
!        to stop numerical rise during stable conditions
!                                                             <990729>
!
!    (3) Enforce SYMIN limit on crosswind area source projection
!                                                             <990729>
!
!    (4) Implement Y2K logic (YYYY format for year)
!
!    (5) Add metric tons/yr as 7th option in emission units
!
!    (6) Add numerical rise integration step DSRISE(m) to control file
!
!    (7) Add check on nx,ny provided in control file (mxnx,mxny)
!
!    (8) Revise distance to final momentum rise calculation in NUMRISE
!
!    (9) Write error messages to list file as well as screen (VEMFAC,
!        VWIDTH, HDUN, SIGMA, SIGSET, RESTARTO, TIBLSET, TIBLGRO, 
!        MFLXSET, YR4, QAYR4)

!               for each species. Time-averaged coupling coefficients
!               are used to compute concentration and wet and dry
!               deposition fluxes.

!                D. Strimaitis
!
! --- PURPOSE:  Create "new" puffs/slugs by splitting old puffs/slugs
!               in the vertical and old puffs in the horizontal when
!               appropriate for tracking effects of wind shear
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- V6.301-V6.402 101111  (DGS): Update GETCELL arguments
! --- V6.3-V6.301   100827  (DGS): horizontal splitting parameters vary
!                                  by met grid domain
! --- V5.72-V6.3    100212  (DGS): add nested CALPUFF grids
! --- V5.4-V5.72    031017  (DGS): ISRCTYP replaces IPUFID
! --- V5.3-V5.4     000602  (DGS): add message to "stop"
!                   000602  (DGS): add horizontal splitting

! ---    each step when simulating a line source (distributed along

! ---    method for the ENTIRE line.  Therefore, we add a marker to
! ---    all slugs after segment 1, so that these can be identified
! ---    and ignored when NEW.  The marker consists of adding 1000 to
! ---    ISRCNUM, which would indicate that the puff comes from
! ---    line-source ISRCNUM=1000+i.  A check is made in READCF which
! ---    stops execution if parameter (mxlines .GE. 1000) to insure

! MODIFICATION:  1.  Changes made during EPA-sponsored upgrade to the
!                    FLOW algorithm have been made here.  This is now
!                    consistent with INPUFF 3.0 (10/93).
!
!                2.  Option added to accept hill information in CTDM
!                    format, or in original OPTHILL format, controlled
!                    by variable MHILLT:
!                               1 = CTDM format
!                               2 = OPTHILL format
!
!                3.  Modify method of computing and incorporating shear
!                    (this differs from INPUFF 3.0 (10/93)
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- V4.0-V5.0     971107  (DGS): Speed shear modification is applied
!                                  only when speed at hilltop is at
!                                  least 1/10 puff speed

! *** LINEAR WIND SHEAR CORRECTIONS ARE ADDED IN SUCH THAT NEUTRAL
!     DEFLECTIONS ARE CORRECT TO LOWEST ORDER IN THE SHEAR GRADIENT.
! *** U''/U = 0 IS ASSUMED BUT N/U IS COMPUTED FROM FR ABOVE HC.

! --- PURPOSE:  Read CALMET meteorological data for one hour
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- V6.3-V6.301   100827  (DGS): Allow nested CALMET files to have
!                                  different time-periods
! --- V6.112-V6.3   100212  (DGS): add nested CALMET grids
! --- V6.1-V6.112   060412  (DGS): add message to "stop" when checking
!                                  for expected time period
! --- V5.7-V6.1     050915  (DGS): allow for begin/end time format
!                                  resolved to seconds, and YYYY
!                                  format used for year (retain
!                                  compatibility with older CALMET)
! --- V5.5-V5.7     030402  (DGS): Add list file unit to YR4 call
!                   030119  (FRR): bug fix to make sure ipcode2d data
!                                  is read in when npsta=-1
!
! ---               090101  (FRR): read CALMET records V5.3, level 010901
! frr (09/01)
! ---  Different format after CALMET version V5.3 - Level 010901
! ---  NOOBS mode allowed (no upper and possibly no surface stations)
! ---  2D records of sf Temp, RH, IPCODE, RHO, QS (previously 1-D)
! ---  Precipitation data if NPSTA>0 or NPSTA=-1 (prognostic rain data)
! ---
! --- V5.2-V5.4     000602  (DGS): add message to "stop"
! --- V5.0-V5.2     991104  (DGS): YYYY format used for year
! --- V5.0-V5.0     990228a (DGS): add IEOF to RDR2D arguments and add
!                                  NEXTFIL to open next CALMET file
! --- V5.0-V5.0     990228  (DGS): correct dimension in call to RDR2D
!                                  for w-field
! --- V4.0-V5.0     971107  (DGS): store w for vertical divergence field
!                   971107  (DGS): add record-skip logic from COMP to
!                                  find current date-time

!
! --- PURPOSE:  Read meteorological data for one hour from AERMET
!               PROFILE file.  This is RDPROF with the following
!               changes:
!               1.  Retain extended data records even though none are
!                   currently expected
!               2.  Wind speed in record is assumed to be the scalar
!                   average
!               3.  Temperature is read as degrees C.
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- V6.1-V6.265   090612  (DGS): Screen use of end-date variables
!                                  when not read from file to avoid
!                                  use of undefined variables (iey)
!                           (DGS): Apply TCLOCK to individual date-time
!                                  variables instead of undefined
!                                  dathr variable
! --- V5.74-V6.1    050915  (DGS): Allow for begin/end time format
!                                  resolved to seconds

!                D. Strimaitis
!
! --- PURPOSE:  Read meteorological data for one hour from CTDM
!               PROFILE and SURFACE files
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- Version 7.3.0, Level 150915 to Version 7.3.1, Level 171103
!     1) When reading AERMOD or CTDM PROFILE.DAT files, fill missing
!        levels.  This will avoid calculations in numerical rise 
!        for PRIME from using missing data flags.  After fills all
!        will be complete for temperature, WS, WD and Scalar WS.
!        Issue arises when multi-level on-site data is used in AERMET
!        and levels are not complete for all variables.  For instance
!        records are present for 2 meter temperature and 10 meter winds.
!        MODIFIED: RDMET4, RDMET5
!     2) Modified reads for AERMOD and CTDM PROFILE.DAT to identify 
!        multi-level profiles where all records are CALM.  Previously
!        CALM profiles were only properly identified for cases with
!        only 1 layer.
!        Issue and Fix contributed by Eric Delisle, SNC-Lavalin

!                                  find current date-time
!                                  and act on PROBLEMs found in XTPRF

!                D. Strimaitis
!
! --- PURPOSE:  Read meteorological data for one hour from AERMET
!               PROFILE and SURFACE files (processing follows that
!               in RDMET4)
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- Version 7.3.0, Level 150915 to Version 7.3.1, Level 171103
!     1) When reading AERMOD or CTDM PROFILE.DAT files, fill missing
!        levels.  This will avoid calculations in numerical rise 
!        for PRIME from using missing data flags.  After fills all
!        will be complete for temperature, WS, WD and Scalar WS.
!        Issue arises when multi-level on-site data is used in AERMET
!        and levels are not complete for all variables.  For instance
!        records are present for 2 meter temperature and 10 meter winds.
!        MODIFIED: RDMET4, RDMET5
!     2) Modified reads for AERMOD and CTDM PROFILE.DAT to identify 
!        multi-level profiles where all records are CALM.  Previously
!        CALM profiles were only properly identified for cases with
!        only 1 layer.

!                                  of RURAL PG sigmas to be used with
!                                  CALMET gridded fields
! --- V6.268-V6.269 100430  (DGS): Reinstate modification made in v6.2
!                                  that uses PRIME wake table to get
!                                  sigmas for puffs at travel distances
!                                  that fall within the limits of the
!                                  table.  PUFRECS change allows this

! --- Notes:
!
!       The transition to the Heffter curves is made when sigma-y
!       grows to SYH, a value provided in the input file.  At this
!       point, BOTH sigma-y and sigma-z begin to follow the time-based
!       Heffter growth rate.  Because dispersion regimes may change
!       one or more times before SYH is attained, the virtual times
!       at the transition point for sigma-y and sigma-z can be very
!       different, and a wide range of "SZH" values may be associated
!       with the single SYH.
!
!       Two methods are needed for identifying SZH.  The FIRST adresses
!       the case in which the current sigma-y and sigma-z are known,

!       The SECOND addresses the case in which sigmas and the
!       corresponding virtuals (time/distance) are known at both
!       ends of a slug, and we must define the virtual time/distance
!       to the transition point along the axis of the slug.  The
!       length of the slug provides the metric for translating THFTY
!       to a position along the axis.  This position is then used to

!
! --- THIS SUBROUTINE RETURNS THE I,J RECEPTOR LOCATION BOUNDS THAT
!     NEED TO BE SEARCHED FOR SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.
!
!     These bounds are computed by looking at the slug endpoints and
!     adding an additional piece, SIGTRY, defined as
!              SIGTRY = SIGCUT * SY * tfaccl        ,
!     to ensure that receptors receiving only partial impacts are
!     included.  Note that SIGCUT is in a DATA statement and SY
!     represents the several relevant values.  The quantity, TFACCL,
!     accounts for any enhanced horizontal spreading due to shear by
!     considering the T factor, TFACC, and applying the condition,
!              tfaccl = amax1(1.0,tfacc)            .

! --- UPDATE
! --- V6.22-V6.267  090710  (DGS): Add max lid height to VCOUP args
!                                  (Equals HLID here since ZGR=0)
! --- V5.73-V6.22   070921  (DGS): Require LCALM=FALSE to disable the
!                                  'frozen puff' treatment, since this

!                                  due to unassigned value of LCALM
! --- V5.4-V5.73    040611  (DGS): add gravitational settling for one
!                                  particle size (plume tilt)
! --- V5.0-V5.4     000602  (DGS): add 'frozen puff' treatment for calms
! --- V4.0-V5.0     971107  (DGS): pass ICODE to VCOUP from /CURRENT/

!***PURPOSE  An easy-to-use code to find a zero of a system of N
!            nonlinear functions in N variables by a modification of
!            the Powell hybrid method.
!***LIBRARY   SLATEC
!***CATEGORY  F2A
!***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (SNSQE-S, DNSQE-D)
!***KEYWORDS  EASY-TO-USE, NONLINEAR SQUARE SYSTEM,
!             POWELL HYBRID METHOD, ZEROS
!***AUTHOR  Hiebert, K. L., (SNLA)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
! 1. Purpose.
!
!
!       The purpose of SNSQE is to find a zero of a system of N non-
!       linear functions in N variables by a modification of the Powell
!       hybrid method.  This is done by using the more general nonlinear
!       equation solver SNSQ.  The user must provide a subroutine which
!       calculates the functions.  The user has the option of either to
!       provide a subroutine which calculates the Jacobian or to let the
!       code calculate it by a forward-difference approximation.  This
!       code is the combination of the MINPACK codes (Argonne) HYBRD1
!       and HYBRJ1.
!
!
! 2. Subroutine and Type Statements.
!
!       SUBROUTINE SNSQE(FCN,JAC,IOPT,N,X,FVEC,TOL,NPRINT,INFO,
!      *                  WA,LWA)
!       INTEGER IOPT,N,NPRINT,INFO,LWA
!       REAL TOL
!       REAL X(N),FVEC(N),WA(LWA)
!       EXTERNAL FCN,JAC
!
!
! 3. Parameters.
!
!       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
!       entry to SNSQE and are not changed on exit, while parameters
!       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
!       and are set to appropriate values on exit from SNSQE.
!
!       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
!         the functions.  FCN must be declared in an EXTERNAL statement
!         in the user calling program, and should be written as follows.
!
!         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)

!
!         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
!         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQE.  In this case, set
!         IFLAG to a negative integer.
!
!       JAC is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
!         the Jacobian.  If IOPT=1, then JAC must be declared in an
!         EXTERNAL statement in the user calling program, and should be
!         written as follows.
!
!         SUBROUTINE JAC(N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG)
!         INTEGER N,LDFJAC,IFLAG
!         REAL X(N),FVEC(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N)
!         ----------
!         Calculate the Jacobian at X and return this
!         matrix in FJAC.  FVEC contains the function
!         values at X and should not be altered.
!         ----------
!         RETURN
!         END
!
!         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by JAC unless the
!         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQE.  In this case, set
!         IFLAG to a negative integer.
!
!         If IOPT=2, JAC can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
!
!       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
!         be calculated.  If IOPT=1, then the user must supply the
!         Jacobian through the subroutine JAC.  If IOPT=2, then the
!         code will approximate the Jacobian by forward-differencing.
!
!       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
!         functions and variables.
!
!       X is an array of length N.  On input, X must contain an initial
!         estimate of the solution vector.  On output, X contains the
!         final estimate of the solution vector.
!
!       FVEC is an output array of length N which contains the functions
!         evaluated at the output X.
!
!       TOL is a non-negative input variable.  Termination occurs when
!         the algorithm estimates that the relative error between X and
!         the solution is at most TOL.  Section 4 contains more details
!         about TOL.
!
!       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
!         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
!         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
!         and every NPRINT iteration thereafter and immediately prior
!         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing. Appropriate
!         print statements must be added to FCN (see example). If NPRINT
!         is not positive, no special calls of FCN with IFLAG = 0 are
!         made.
!
!       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
!         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
!         description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.

!
!         INFO = 1  algorithm estimates that the relative error between

!                   100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for IOPT=2.
!
!         INFO = 3  TOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
!                   approximate solution X is possible.
!
!         INFO = 4  iteration is not making good progress.
!
!         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.
!
!       WA is a work array of length LWA.
!
!       LWA is a positive integer input variable not less than
!         (3*N**2+13*N))/2.
!
!
! 4. Successful Completion.
!
!       The accuracy of SNSQE is controlled by the convergence parame-
!       ter TOL.  This parameter is used in a test which makes a compar-
!       ison between the approximation X and a solution XSOL.  SNSQE
!       terminates when the test is satisfied.  If TOL is less than the
!       machine precision (as defined by the function R1MACH(4)), then
!       SNSQE attempts only to satisfy the test defined by the machine
!       precision.  Further progress is not usually possible.  Unless
!       high precision solutions are required, the recommended value
!       for TOL is the square root of the machine precision.
!
!       The test assumes that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
!       and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
!       and the Jacobian  coded consistently.  If these conditions
!       are not satisfied, SNSQE may incorrectly indicate convergence.
!       The coding of the Jacobian can be checked by the subroutine
!       CHKDER.  If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=2, then
!       the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
!       rerunning SNSQE with a tighter tolerance.
!
!       Convergence Test.  If ENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm of a
!         vector Z, then this test attempts to guarantee that
!
!               ENORM(X-XSOL) .LE.  TOL*ENORM(XSOL).
!
!         If this condition is satisfied with TOL = 10**(-K), then the
!         larger components of X have K significant decimal digits and
!         INFO is set to 1.  There is a danger that the smaller compo-
!         nents of X may have large relative errors, but the fast rate
!         of convergence of SNSQE usually avoids this possibility.
!
!
! 5. Unsuccessful Completion.
!
!       Unsuccessful termination of SNSQE can be due to improper input
!       parameters, arithmetic interrupts, an excessive number of func-
!       tion evaluations, errors in the functions, or lack of good prog-
!       ress.
!
!       Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT .LT. 1, or
!         IOPT .GT. 2, or N .LE. 0, or TOL .LT. 0.E0, or
!         LWA .LT. (3*N**2+13*N)/2.
!
!       Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
!         subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
!         be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by SNSQE.  In this
!         case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by not evalu-
!         ating the functions here, but instead setting the components
!         of FVEC to numbers that exceed those in the initial FVEC.
!
!       Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  If the number of
!         calls to FCN reaches 100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for
!         IOPT=2, then this indicates that the routine is converging
!         very slowly as measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is
!         set to 2.  This situation should be unusual because, as
!         indicated below, lack of good progress is usually diagnosed
!         earlier by SNSQE, causing termination with INFO = 4.
!
!       Errors in the Functions.  When IOPT=2, the choice of step length
!         in the forward-difference approximation to the Jacobian
!         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
!         order of the machine precision.  If this is not the case,
!         SNSQE may fail (usually with INFO = 4).  The user should
!         then either use SNSQ and set the step length or use IOPT=1
!         and supply the Jacobian.
!
!       Lack of Good Progress.  SNSQE searches for a zero of the system
!         by minimizing the sum of the squares of the functions.  In so
!         doing, it can become trapped in a region where the minimum
!         does not correspond to a zero of the system and, in this situ-
!         ation, the iteration eventually fails to make good progress.
!         In particular, this will happen if the system does not have a
!         zero.  If the system has a zero, rerunning SNSQE from a dif-
!         ferent starting point may be helpful.
!
!
! 6. Characteristics of the Algorithm.
!
!       SNSQE is a modification of the Powell hybrid method.  Two of
!       its main characteristics involve the choice of the correction as
!       a convex combination of the Newton and scaled gradient direc-
!       tions, and the updating of the Jacobian by the rank-1 method of
!       Broyden.  The choice of the correction guarantees (under reason-
!       able conditions) global convergence for starting points far from
!       the solution and a fast rate of convergence.  The Jacobian is
!       calculated at the starting point by either the user-supplied
!       subroutine or a forward-difference approximation, but it is not
!       recalculated until the rank-1 method fails to produce satis-
!       factory progress.
!
!       Timing.  The time required by SNSQE to solve a given problem
!         depends on N, the behavior of the functions, the accuracy
!         requested, and the starting point.  The number of arithmetic
!         operations needed by SNSQE is about 11.5*(N**2) to process
!         each evaluation of the functions (call to FCN) and 1.3*(N**3)
!         to process each evaluation of the Jacobian (call to JAC,
!         if IOPT = 1).  Unless FCN and JAC can be evaluated quickly,
!         the timing of SNSQE will be strongly influenced by the time
!         spent in FCN and JAC.
!
!       Storage.  SNSQE requires (3*N**2 + 17*N)/2 single precision
!         storage locations, in addition to the storage required by the
!         program.  There are no internally declared storage arrays.
!
!
! 7. Example.
!
!       The problem is to determine the values of X(1), X(2), ..., X(9),
!       which solve the system of tridiagonal equations
!
!       (3-2*X(1))*X(1)           -2*X(2)                   = -1
!               -X(I-1) + (3-2*X(I))*X(I)         -2*X(I+1) = -1, I=2-8
!                                   -X(8) + (3-2*X(9))*X(9) = -1

!***DESCRIPTION
!
! 1. Purpose.
!
!       The purpose of SNSQ is to find a zero of a system of N non-
!       linear functions in N variables by a modification of the Powell
!       hybrid method.  The user must provide a subroutine which calcu-
!       lates the functions.  The user has the option of either to
!       provide a subroutine which calculates the Jacobian or to let the
!       code calculate it by a forward-difference approximation.
!       This code is the combination of the MINPACK codes (Argonne)
!       HYBRD and HYBRDJ.
!
!
! 2. Subroutine and Type Statements.
!
!       SUBROUTINE SNSQ(FCN,JAC,IOPT,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,XTOL,MAXFEV,
!      *                 ML,MU,EPSFCN,DIAG,MODE,FACTOR,NPRINT,INFO,NFEV,
!      *                 NJEV,R,LR,QTF,WA1,WA2,WA3,WA4)

!       REAL XTOL,EPSFCN,FACTOR
!       REAL X(N),FVEC(N),DIAG(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N),R(LR),QTF(N),
!      *     WA1(N),WA2(N),WA3(N),WA4(N)
!       EXTERNAL FCN,JAC
!
!
! 3. Parameters.
!
!       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
!       entry to SNSQ and are not changed on exit, while parameters
!       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
!       and are set to appropriate values on exit from SNSQ.
!
!       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
!         the functions.  FCN must be declared in an EXTERNAL statement
!         in the user calling program, and should be written as follows.
!
!         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
!         INTEGER N,IFLAG
!         REAL X(N),FVEC(N)
!         ----------
!         Calculate the functions at X and
!         return this vector in FVEC.
!         ----------
!         RETURN
!         END
!
!         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
!         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQ.  In this case, set
!         IFLAG to a negative integer.
!
!       JAC is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
!         the Jacobian.  If IOPT=1, then JAC must be declared in an
!         EXTERNAL statement in the user calling program, and should be
!         written as follows.
!
!         SUBROUTINE JAC(N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG)
!         INTEGER N,LDFJAC,IFLAG
!         REAL X(N),FVEC(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N)
!         ----------
!         Calculate the Jacobian at X and return this
!         matrix in FJAC.  FVEC contains the function
!         values at X and should not be altered.
!         ----------
!         RETURN
!         END
!
!         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by JAC unless the
!         user wants to terminate execution of SNSQ.  In this case, set
!         IFLAG to a negative integer.
!
!         If IOPT=2, JAC can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
!
!       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
!         be calculated.  If IOPT=1, then the user must supply the
!         Jacobian through the subroutine JAC.  If IOPT=2, then the
!         code will approximate the Jacobian by forward-differencing.
!
!       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
!         functions and variables.
!
!       X is an array of length N.  On input, X must contain an initial
!         estimate of the solution vector.  On output, X contains the
!         final estimate of the solution vector.
!
!       FVEC is an output array of length N which contains the functions
!         evaluated at the output X.
!
!       FJAC is an output N by N array which contains the orthogonal
!         matrix Q produced by the QR factorization of the final approx-
!         imate Jacobian.
!
!       LDFJAC is a positive integer input variable not less than N
!         which specifies the leading dimension of the array FJAC.
!
!       XTOL is a non-negative input variable.  Termination occurs when
!         the relative error between two consecutive iterates is at most
!         XTOL.  Therefore, XTOL measures the relative error desired in
!         the approximate solution.  Section 4 contains more details
!         about XTOL.
!
!       MAXFEV is a positive integer input variable.  Termination occurs
!         when the number of calls to FCN is at least MAXFEV by the end
!         of an iteration.

!       ML is a non-negative integer input variable which specifies the
!         number of subdiagonals within the band of the Jacobian matrix.
!         If the Jacobian is not banded or IOPT=1, set ML to at
!         least N - 1.
!
!       MU is a non-negative integer input variable which specifies the
!         number of superdiagonals within the band of the Jacobian
!         matrix.  If the Jacobian is not banded or IOPT=1, set MU to at
!         least N - 1.
!
!       EPSFCN is an input variable used in determining a suitable step
!         for the forward-difference approximation.  This approximation
!         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
!         order of EPSFCN.  If EPSFCN is less than the machine preci-
!         sion, it is assumed that the relative errors in the functions
!         are of the order of the machine precision.  If IOPT=1, then
!         EPSFCN can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
!
!       DIAG is an array of length N.  If MODE = 1 (see below), DIAG is
!         internally set.  If MODE = 2, DIAG must contain positive
!         entries that serve as implicit (multiplicative) scale factors
!         for the variables.
!
!       MODE is an integer input variable.  If MODE = 1, the variables
!         will be scaled internally.  If MODE = 2, the scaling is speci-
!         fied by the input DIAG.  Other values of MODE are equivalent
!         to MODE = 1.
!
!       FACTOR is a positive input variable used in determining the ini-
!         tial step bound.  This bound is set to the product of FACTOR
!         and the Euclidean norm of DIAG*X if nonzero, or else to FACTOR
!         itself.  In most cases FACTOR should lie in the interval
!         (.1,100.).  100. is a generally recommended value.
!
!       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
!         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
!         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
!         and every NPRINT iteration thereafter and immediately prior
!         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing. Appropriate
!         print statements must be added to FCN(see example).  If NPRINT
!         is not positive, no special calls of FCN with IFLAG = 0 are
!         made.
!
!       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
!         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
!         description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
!
!         INFO = 0  improper input parameters.
!
!         INFO = 1  relative error between two consecutive iterates is
!                   at most XTOL.
!
!         INFO = 2  number of calls to FCN has reached or exceeded
!                   MAXFEV.
!
!         INFO = 3  XTOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
!                   approximate solution X is possible.
!
!         INFO = 4  iteration is not making good progress, as measured
!                   by the improvement from the last five Jacobian eval-
!                   uations.
!
!         INFO = 5  iteration is not making good progress, as measured
!                   by the improvement from the last ten iterations.
!
!         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.
!
!       NFEV is an integer output variable set to the number of calls to
!         FCN.
!
!       NJEV is an integer output variable set to the number of calls to
!         JAC. (If IOPT=2, then NJEV is set to zero.)
!
!       R is an output array of length LR which contains the upper
!         triangular matrix produced by the QR factorization of the
!         final approximate Jacobian, stored rowwise.
!
!       LR is a positive integer input variable not less than
!         (N*(N+1))/2.
!
!       QTF is an output array of length N which contains the vector
!         (Q TRANSPOSE)*FVEC.
!
!       WA1, WA2, WA3, and WA4 are work arrays of length N.
!
!
! 4. Successful Completion.
!
!       The accuracy of SNSQ is controlled by the convergence parameter
!       XTOL.  This parameter is used in a test which makes a comparison
!       between the approximation X and a solution XSOL.  SNSQ termi-
!       nates when the test is satisfied.  If the convergence parameter
!       is less than the machine precision (as defined by the function
!       R1MACH(4)), then SNSQ only attempts to satisfy the test
!       defined by the machine precision.  Further progress is not
!       usually possible.
!
!       The test assumes that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
!       and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
!       and the Jacobian are coded consistently.  If these conditions
!       are not satisfied, then SNSQ may incorrectly indicate conver-
!       gence.  The coding of the Jacobian can be checked by the
!       subroutine CHKDER. If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=2,
!       then the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
!       rerunning SNSQ with a tighter tolerance.
!
!       Convergence Test.  If ENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm of a
!         vector Z and D is the diagonal matrix whose entries are
!         defined by the array DIAG, then this test attempts to guaran-
!         tee that
!
!               ENORM(D*(X-XSOL)) .LE. XTOL*ENORM(D*XSOL).
!
!         If this condition is satisfied with XTOL = 10**(-K), then the
!         larger components of D*X have K significant decimal digits and
!         INFO is set to 1.  There is a danger that the smaller compo-
!         nents of D*X may have large relative errors, but the fast rate
!         of convergence of SNSQ usually avoids this possibility.
!         Unless high precision solutions are required, the recommended
!         value for XTOL is the square root of the machine precision.
!
!
! 5. Unsuccessful Completion.
!
!       Unsuccessful termination of SNSQ can be due to improper input
!       parameters, arithmetic interrupts, an excessive number of func-
!       tion evaluations, or lack of good progress.
!
!       Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT .LT. 1,
!         or IOPT .GT. 2, or N .LE. 0, or LDFJAC .LT. N, or
!         XTOL .LT. 0.E0, or MAXFEV .LE. 0, or ML .LT. 0, or MU .LT. 0,
!         or FACTOR .LE. 0.E0, or LR .LT. (N*(N+1))/2.
!
!       Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
!         subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
!         be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by SNSQ.  In this
!         case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by rerunning
!         SNSQ with a smaller value of FACTOR.
!
!       Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  A reasonable value
!         for MAXFEV is 100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 and 200*(N+1) for IOPT=2.
!         If the number of calls to FCN reaches MAXFEV, then this
!         indicates that the routine is converging very slowly as
!         measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is set to 2.  This
!         situation should be unusual because, as indicated below, lack
!         of good progress is usually diagnosed earlier by SNSQ,
!         causing termination with INFO = 4 or INFO = 5.
!
!       Lack of Good Progress.  SNSQ searches for a zero of the system
!         by minimizing the sum of the squares of the functions.  In so
!         doing, it can become trapped in a region where the minimum
!         does not correspond to a zero of the system and, in this situ-
!         ation, the iteration eventually fails to make good progress.
!         In particular, this will happen if the system does not have a
!         zero.  If the system has a zero, rerunning SNSQ from a dif-
!         ferent starting point may be helpful.
!
!
! 6. Characteristics of the Algorithm.
!
!       SNSQ is a modification of the Powell hybrid method.  Two of its
!       main characteristics involve the choice of the correction as a
!       convex combination of the Newton and scaled gradient directions,
!       and the updating of the Jacobian by the rank-1 method of Broy-
!       den.  The choice of the correction guarantees (under reasonable
!       conditions) global convergence for starting points far from the
!       solution and a fast rate of convergence.  The Jacobian is
!       calculated at the starting point by either the user-supplied
!       subroutine or a forward-difference approximation, but it is not
!       recalculated until the rank-1 method fails to produce satis-
!       factory progress.
!
!       Timing.  The time required by SNSQ to solve a given problem
!         depends on N, the behavior of the functions, the accuracy
!         requested, and the starting point.  The number of arithmetic
!         operations needed by SNSQ is about 11.5*(N**2) to process
!         each evaluation of the functions (call to FCN) and 1.3*(N**3)
!         to process each evaluation of the Jacobian (call to JAC,
!         if IOPT = 1).  Unless FCN and JAC can be evaluated quickly,
!         the timing of SNSQ will be strongly influenced by the time
!         spent in FCN and JAC.
!
!       Storage.  SNSQ requires (3*N**2 + 17*N)/2 single precision
!         storage locations, in addition to the storage required by the
!         program.  There are no internally declared storage arrays.
!
!
! 7. Example.
!
!       The problem is to determine the values of X(1), X(2), ..., X(9),
!       which solve the system of tridiagonal equations
!
!       (3-2*X(1))*X(1)           -2*X(2)                   = -1
!               -X(I-1) + (3-2*X(I))*X(I)         -2*X(I+1) = -1, I=2-8
!                                   -X(8) + (3-2*X(9))*X(9) = -1

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     Given an M by N matrix A, an N by N nonsingular DIAGONAL
!     matrix D, an M-vector B, and a positive number DELTA, the
!     problem is to determine the convex combination X of the
!     Gauss-Newton and scaled gradient directions that minimizes
!     (A*X - B) in the least squares sense, subject to the
!     restriction that the Euclidean norm of D*X be at most DELTA.
!
!     This subroutine completes the solution of the problem
!     if it is provided with the necessary information from the
!     QR factorization of A. That is, if A = Q*R, where Q has
!     orthogonal columns and R is an upper triangular matrix,
!     then DOGLEG expects the full upper triangle of R and
!     the first N components of (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.
!
!     The subroutine statement is
!
!       SUBROUTINE DOGLEG(N,R,LR,DIAG,QTB,DELTA,X,WA1,WA2)
!
!     where
!
!       N is a positive integer input variable set to the order of R.
!
!       R is an input array of length LR which must contain the upper
!         triangular matrix R stored by rows.
!
!       LR is a positive integer input variable not less than
!         (N*(N+1))/2.
!
!       DIAG is an input array of length N which must contain the
!         diagonal elements of the matrix D.
!
!       QTB is an input array of length N which must contain the first
!         N elements of the vector (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.
!
!       DELTA is a positive input variable which specifies an upper
!         bound on the Euclidean norm of D*X.
!
!       X is an output array of length N which contains the desired
!         convex combination of the Gauss-Newton direction and the
!         scaled gradient direction.
!
!       WA1 and WA2 are work arrays of length N.

      SUBROUTINE FDJAC1 (FCN, N, X, FVEC, FJAC, LDFJAC, IFLAG, ML, MU,&
         EPSFCN, WA1, WA2)
!***BEGIN PROLOGUE  FDJAC1
!***SUBSIDIARY
!***PURPOSE  Subsidiary to SNSQ and SNSQE
!***LIBRARY   SLATEC
!***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (FDJAC1-S, DFDJC1-D)
!***AUTHOR  (UNKNOWN)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     This subroutine computes a forward-difference approximation
!     to the N by N Jacobian matrix associated with a specified
!     problem of N functions in N VARIABLES. If the Jacobian has
!     a banded form, then function evaluations are saved by only
!     approximating the nonzero terms.
!
!     The subroutine statement is
!
!       SUBROUTINE FDJAC1(FCN,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG,ML,MU,EPSFCN,
!                         WA1,WA2)
!
!     where
!
!       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
!         calculates the functions. FCN must be declared
!         in an external statement in the user calling
!         program, and should be written as follows.
!
!         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
!         INTEGER N,IFLAG
!         REAL X(N),FVEC(N)
!         ----------
!         Calculate the functions at X and
!         return this vector in FVEC.
!         ----------
!         RETURN
!         END
!
!         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless
!         the user wants to terminate execution of FDJAC1.
!         In this case set IFLAG to a negative integer.
!
!       N Is a positive integer input variable set to the number
!         of functions and variables.
!
!       X is an input array of length N.
!
!       FVEC is an input array of length N which must contain the
!         functions evaluated at X.
!
!       FJAC is an output N by N array which contains the
!         approximation to the Jacobian matrix evaluated at X.
!
!       LDFJAC is a positive integer input variable not less than N
!         which specifies the leading dimension of the array FJAC.
!
!       IFLAG is an integer variable which can be used to terminate
!         the execution of FDJAC1. See description of FCN.
!
!       ML is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
!         the number of subdiagonals within the band of the
!         Jacobian matrix. If the Jacobian is not banded, set
!         ML to at least N - 1.
!
!       EPSFCN is an input variable used in determining a suitable
!         step length for the forward-difference approximation. This
!         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the
!         functions are of the order of EPSFCN. If EPSFCN is less
!         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative
!         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
!         precision.
!
!       MU is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
!         the number of superdiagonals within the band of the
!         Jacobian matrix. If the Jacobian is not banded, set
!         MU to at least N - 1.
!
!       WA1 and WA2 are work arrays of length N. If ML + MU + 1 is at
!         least N, then the Jacobian is considered dense, and WA2 is
!         not referenced.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!   I1MACH can be used to obtain machine-dependent parameters for the
!   local machine environment.  It is a function subprogram with one
!   (input) argument and can be referenced as follows:
!
!        K = I1MACH(I)
!
!   where I=1,...,16.  The (output) value of K above is determined by
!   the (input) value of I.  The results for various values of I are
!   discussed below.
!
!   I/O unit numbers:
!     I1MACH( 1) = the standard input unit.
!     I1MACH( 2) = the standard output unit.
!     I1MACH( 3) = the standard punch unit.
!     I1MACH( 4) = the standard error message unit.
!
!   Words:
!     I1MACH( 5) = the number of bits per integer storage unit.
!     I1MACH( 6) = the number of characters per integer storage unit.
!
!   Integers:
!     assume integers are represented in the S-digit, base-A form
!
!                sign ( X(S-1)*A**(S-1) + ... + X(1)*A + X(0) )
!
!                where 0 .LE. X(I) .LT. A for I=0,...,S-1.
!     I1MACH( 7) = A, the base.
!     I1MACH( 8) = S, the number of base-A digits.
!     I1MACH( 9) = A**S - 1, the largest magnitude.
!
!   Floating-Point Numbers:
!     Assume floating-point numbers are represented in the T-digit,
!     base-B form
!                sign (B**E)*( (X(1)/B) + ... + (X(T)/B**T) )
!
!                where 0 .LE. X(I) .LT. B for I=1,...,T,
!                0 .LT. X(1), and EMIN .LE. E .LE. EMAX.
!     I1MACH(10) = B, the base.
!
!   Single-Precision:
!     I1MACH(11) = T, the number of base-B digits.
!     I1MACH(12) = EMIN, the smallest exponent E.
!     I1MACH(13) = EMAX, the largest exponent E.
!
!   Double-Precision:
!     I1MACH(14) = T, the number of base-B digits.
!     I1MACH(15) = EMIN, the smallest exponent E.
!     I1MACH(16) = EMAX, the largest exponent E.
!
!   To alter this function for a particular environment, the desired
!   set of DATA statements should be activated by removing the C from
!   column 1.  Also, the values of I1MACH(1) - I1MACH(4) should be
!   checked for consistency with the local operating system.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     Abstract
!        J4SAVE saves and recalls several global variables needed
!        by the library error handling routines.
!
!     Description of Parameters
!      --Input--
!        IWHICH - Index of item desired.
!                = 1 Refers to current error number.
!                = 2 Refers to current error control flag.
!                = 3 Refers to current unit number to which error
!                    messages are to be sent.  (0 means use standard.)
!                = 4 Refers to the maximum number of times any
!                     message is to be printed (as set by XERMAX).
!                = 5 Refers to the total number of units to which
!                     each error message is to be written.
!                = 6 Refers to the 2nd unit for error messages
!                = 7 Refers to the 3rd unit for error messages
!                = 8 Refers to the 4th unit for error messages
!                = 9 Refers to the 5th unit for error messages
!        IVALUE - The value to be set for the IWHICH-th parameter,
!                 if ISET is .TRUE. .
!        ISET   - If ISET=.TRUE., the IWHICH-th parameter will BE
!                 given the value, IVALUE.  If ISET=.FALSE., the
!                 IWHICH-th parameter will be unchanged, and IVALUE
!                 is a dummy parameter.
!      --Output--
!        The (old) value of the IWHICH-th parameter will be returned
!        in the function value, J4SAVE.

!DECK QRFAC
      SUBROUTINE QRFAC (M, N, A, LDA, PIVOT, IPVT, LIPVT, SIGMA, ACNORM,&
         WA)
!***BEGIN PROLOGUE  QRFAC
!***SUBSIDIARY
!***PURPOSE  Subsidiary to SNLS1, SNLS1E, SNSQ and SNSQE
!***LIBRARY   SLATEC
!***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (QRFAC-S, DQRFAC-D)
!***AUTHOR  (UNKNOWN)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     This subroutine uses Householder transformations with column
!     pivoting (optional) to compute a QR factorization of the
!     M by N matrix A. That is, QRFAC determines an orthogonal
!     matrix Q, a permutation matrix P, and an upper trapezoidal
!     matrix R with diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude,
!     such that A*P = Q*R. The Householder transformation for
!     column K, K = 1,2,...,MIN(M,N), is of the form
!
!                           T
!           I - (1/U(K))*U*U
!
!     where U has zeros in the first K-1 positions. The form of
!     this transformation and the method of pivoting first
!     appeared in the corresponding LINPACK subroutine.
!
!     The subroutine statement is
!
!       SUBROUTINE QRFAC(M,N,A,LDA,PIVOT,IPVT,LIPVT,SIGMA,ACNORM,WA)
!
!     where
!
!       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number
!         of rows of A.
!
!       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number
!         of columns of A.
!
!       A is an M by N array. On input A contains the matrix for
!         which the QR factorization is to be computed. On output
!         the strict upper trapezoidal part of A contains the strict
!         upper trapezoidal part of R, and the lower trapezoidal
!         part of A contains a factored form of Q (the non-trivial
!         elements of the U vectors described above).
!
!       LDA is a positive integer input variable not less than M
!         which specifies the leading dimension of the array A.
!
!       PIVOT is a logical input variable. If pivot is set .TRUE.,
!         then column pivoting is enforced. If pivot is set .FALSE.,
!         then no column pivoting is done.
!
!       IPVT is an integer output array of length LIPVT. IPVT
!         defines the permutation matrix P such that A*P = Q*R.
!         Column J of P is column IPVT(J) of the identity matrix.
!         If pivot is .FALSE., IPVT is not referenced.
!
!       LIPVT is a positive integer input variable. If PIVOT is
!             .FALSE., then LIPVT may be as small as 1. If PIVOT is
!             .TRUE., then LIPVT must be at least N.
!
!       SIGMA is an output array of length N which contains the
!         diagonal elements of R.
!
!       ACNORM is an output array of length N which contains the
!         norms of the corresponding columns of the input matrix A.
!         If this information is not needed, then ACNORM can coincide
!         with SIGMA.
!
!       WA is a work array of length N. If pivot is .FALSE., then WA
!         can coincide with SIGMA.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!   R1MACH can be used to obtain machine-dependent parameters for the
!   local machine environment.  It is a function subprogram with one
!   (input) argument, and can be referenced as follows:
!
!        A = R1MACH(I)
!
!   where I=1,...,5.  The (output) value of A above is determined by
!   the (input) value of I.  The results for various values of I are
!   discussed below.
!
!   R1MACH(1) = B**(EMIN-1), the smallest positive magnitude.
!   R1MACH(2) = B**EMAX*(1 - B**(-T)), the largest magnitude.
!   R1MACH(3) = B**(-T), the smallest relative spacing.
!   R1MACH(4) = B**(1-T), the largest relative spacing.
!   R1MACH(5) = LOG10(B)
!
!   Assume single precision numbers are represented in the T-digit,
!   base-B form
!
!              sign (B**E)*( (X(1)/B) + ... + (X(T)/B**T) )
!
!   where 0 .LE. X(I) .LT. B for I=1,...,T, 0 .LT. X(1), and
!   EMIN .LE. E .LE. EMAX.
!
!   The values of B, T, EMIN and EMAX are provided in I1MACH as
!   follows:
!   I1MACH(10) = B, the base.
!   I1MACH(11) = T, the number of base-B digits.
!   I1MACH(12) = EMIN, the smallest exponent E.
!   I1MACH(13) = EMAX, the largest exponent E.
!
!   To alter this function for a particular environment, the desired
!   set of DATA statements should be activated by removing the C from
!   column 1.  Also, the values of R1MACH(1) - R1MACH(4) should be
!   checked for consistency with the local operating system.

!
!     Abstract
!        Allows user control over handling of individual errors.
!        Just after each message is recorded, but before it is
!        processed any further (i.e., before it is printed or
!        a decision to abort is made), a call is made to XERCNT.
!        If the user has provided his own version of XERCNT, he
!        can then override the value of KONTROL used in processing
!        this message by redefining its value.
!        KONTRL may be set to any value from -2 to 2.
!        The meanings for KONTRL are the same as in XSETF, except
!        that the value of KONTRL changes only for this message.
!        If KONTRL is set to a value outside the range from -2 to 2,
!        it will be moved back into that range.
!
!     Description of Parameters
!
!      --Input--
!        LIBRAR - the library that the routine is in.
!        SUBROU - the subroutine that XERMSG is being called from
!        MESSG  - the first 20 characters of the error message.
!        NERR   - same as in the call to XERMSG.
!        LEVEL  - same as in the call to XERMSG.
!        KONTRL - the current value of the control flag as set
!                 by a call to XSETF.
!
!      --Output--
!        KONTRL - the new value of KONTRL.  If KONTRL is not
!                 defined, it will remain at its original value.
!                 This changed value of control affects only
!                 the current occurrence of the current message.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!   XERMSG processes a diagnostic message in a manner determined by the
!   value of LEVEL and the current value of the library error control
!   flag, KONTRL.  See subroutine XSETF for details.
!
!    LIBRAR   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
!             of the library.  This will be 'SLATEC' for the SLATEC
!             Common Math Library.  The error handling package is
!             general enough to be used by many libraries
!             simultaneously, so it is desirable for the routine that
!             detects and reports an error to identify the library name
!             as well as the routine name.
!
!    SUBROU   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
!             of the routine that detected the error.  Usually it is the
!             name of the routine that is calling XERMSG.  There are
!             some instances where a user callable library routine calls
!             lower level subsidiary routines where the error is
!             detected.  In such cases it may be more informative to
!             supply the name of the routine the user called rather than
!             the name of the subsidiary routine that detected the
!             error.
!
!    MESSG    A character constant (or character variable) with the text
!             of the error or warning message.  In the example below,
!             the message is a character constant that contains a
!             generic message.
!
!                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY',
!                  *'THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS THE ROW DIMENSION',
!                  *3, 1)
!
!             It is possible (and is sometimes desirable) to generate a
!             specific message--e.g., one that contains actual numeric
!             values.  Specific numeric values can be converted into
!             character strings using formatted WRITE statements into
!             character variables.  This is called standard Fortran
!             internal file I/O and is exemplified in the first three
!             lines of the following example.  You can also catenate
!             substrings of characters to construct the error message.
!             Here is an example showing the use of both writing to
!             an internal file and catenating character strings.
!
!                   CHARACTER*5 CHARN, CHARL
!                   WRITE (CHARN,10) N
!                   WRITE (CHARL,10) LDA
!                10 FORMAT(I5)
!                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY', 'THE ORDER'//CHARN//
!                  *   ' OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS ITS ROW DIMENSION OF'//
!                  *   CHARL, 3, 1)
!
!             There are two subtleties worth mentioning.  One is that
!             the // for character catenation is used to construct the
!             error message so that no single character constant is
!             continued to the next line.  This avoids confusion as to
!             whether there are trailing blanks at the end of the line.
!             The second is that by catenating the parts of the message
!             as an actual argument rather than encoding the entire
!             message into one large character variable, we avoid
!             having to know how long the message will be in order to
!             declare an adequate length for that large character
!             variable.  XERMSG calls XERPRN to print the message using
!             multiple lines if necessary.  If the message is very long,
!             XERPRN will break it into pieces of 72 characters (as
!             requested by XERMSG) for printing on multiple lines.
!             Also, XERMSG asks XERPRN to prefix each line with ' *  '
!             so that the total line length could be 76 characters.
!             Note also that XERPRN scans the error message backwards
!             to ignore trailing blanks.  Another feature is that
!             the substring '$$' is treated as a new line sentinel
!             by XERPRN.  If you want to construct a multiline
!             message without having to count out multiples of 72
!             characters, just use '$$' as a separator.  '$$'
!             obviously must occur within 72 characters of the
!             start of each line to have its intended effect since
!             XERPRN is asked to wrap around at 72 characters in
!             addition to looking for '$$'.
!
!    NERR     An integer value that is chosen by the library routine's
!             author.  It must be in the range -99 to 999 (three
!             printable digits).  Each distinct error should have its
!             own error number.  These error numbers should be described
!             in the machine readable documentation for the routine.
!             The error numbers need be unique only within each routine,
!             so it is reasonable for each routine to start enumerating
!             errors from 1 and proceeding to the next integer.
!
!    LEVEL    An integer value in the range 0 to 2 that indicates the
!             level (severity) of the error.  Their meanings are
!
!            -1  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
!                that there really is an error, but the user's attention
!                may be needed.  An attempt is made to only print this
!                message once.
!
!             0  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
!                that there really is an error, but the user's attention
!                may be needed.
!
!             1  A recoverable error.  This is used even if the error is
!                so serious that the routine cannot return any useful
!                answer.  If the user has told the error package to
!                return after recoverable errors, then XERMSG will
!                return to the Library routine which can then return to
!                the user's routine.  The user may also permit the error
!                package to terminate the program upon encountering a
!                recoverable error.
!
!             2  A fatal error.  XERMSG will not return to its caller
!                after it receives a fatal error.  This level should
!                hardly ever be used; it is much better to allow the
!                user a chance to recover.  An example of one of the few
!                cases in which it is permissible to declare a level 2
!                error is a reverse communication Library routine that
!                is likely to be called repeatedly until it integrates
!                across some interval.  If there is a serious error in
!                the input such that another step cannot be taken and
!                the Library routine is called again without the input
!                error having been corrected by the caller, the Library
!                routine will probably be called forever with improper
!                input.  In this case, it is reasonable to declare the
!                error to be fatal.
!
!    Each of the arguments to XERMSG is input; none will be modified by
!    XERMSG.  A routine may make multiple calls to XERMSG with warning
!    level messages; however, after a call to XERMSG with a recoverable
!    error, the routine should return to the user.  Do not try to call
!    XERMSG with a second recoverable error after the first recoverable
!    error because the error package saves the error number.  The user
!    can retrieve this error number by calling another entry point in
!    the error handling package and then clear the error number when
!    recovering from the error.  Calling XERMSG in succession causes the
!    old error number to be overwritten by the latest error number.
!    This is considered harmless for error numbers associated with
!    warning messages but must not be done for error numbers of serious
!    errors.  After a call to XERMSG with a recoverable error, the user
!    must be given a chance to call NUMXER or XERCLR to retrieve or
!    clear the error number.

!***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
!   880101  DATE WRITTEN
!   880621  REVISED AS DIRECTED AT SLATEC CML MEETING OF FEBRUARY 1988.
!           THERE ARE TWO BASIC CHANGES.
!           1.  A NEW ROUTINE, XERPRN, IS USED INSTEAD OF XERPRT TO
!               PRINT MESSAGES.  THIS ROUTINE WILL BREAK LONG MESSAGES
!               INTO PIECES FOR PRINTING ON MULTIPLE LINES.  '$$' IS
!               ACCEPTED AS A NEW LINE SENTINEL.  A PREFIX CAN BE
!               ADDED TO EACH LINE TO BE PRINTED.  XERMSG USES EITHER
!               ' ***' OR ' *  ' AND LONG MESSAGES ARE BROKEN EVERY
!               72 CHARACTERS (AT MOST) SO THAT THE MAXIMUM LINE
!               LENGTH OUTPUT CAN NOW BE AS GREAT AS 76.
!           2.  THE TEXT OF ALL MESSAGES IS NOW IN UPPER CASE SINCE THE
!               FORTRAN STANDARD DOCUMENT DOES NOT ADMIT THE EXISTENCE
!               OF LOWER CASE.
!   880708  REVISED AFTER THE SLATEC CML MEETING OF JUNE 29 AND 30.
!           THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES ARE
!           1.  CLARIFY COMMENTS IN THE PROLOGUES
!           2.  RENAME XRPRNT TO XERPRN
!           3.  REWORK HANDLING OF '$$' IN XERPRN TO HANDLE BLANK LINES
!               SIMILAR TO THE WAY FORMAT STATEMENTS HANDLE THE /

      SUBROUTINE XERPRN (PREFIX, NPREF, MESSG, NWRAP)
!***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERPRN
!***SUBSIDIARY
!***PURPOSE  Print error messages processed by XERMSG.
!***LIBRARY   SLATEC (XERROR)
!***CATEGORY  R3C
!***TYPE      ALL (XERPRN-A)
!***KEYWORDS  ERROR MESSAGES, PRINTING, XERROR
!***AUTHOR  Fong, Kirby, (NMFECC at LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
! This routine sends one or more lines to each of the (up to five)
! logical units to which error messages are to be sent.  This routine
! is called several times by XERMSG, sometimes with a single line to
! print and sometimes with a (potentially very long) message that may
! wrap around into multiple lines.
!
! PREFIX  Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This argument contains
!         characters to be put at the beginning of each line before
!         the body of the message.  No more than 16 characters of
!         PREFIX will be used.
!
! NPREF   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This argument is the number
!         of characters to use from PREFIX.  If it is negative, the
!         intrinsic function LEN is used to determine its length.  If
!         it is zero, PREFIX is not used.  If it exceeds 16 or if
!         LEN(PREFIX) exceeds 16, only the first 16 characters will be
!         used.  If NPREF is positive and the length of PREFIX is less
!         than NPREF, a copy of PREFIX extended with blanks to length
!         NPREF will be used.
!
! MESSG   Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This is the text of a
!         message to be printed.  If it is a long message, it will be
!         broken into pieces for printing on multiple lines.  Each line
!         will start with the appropriate prefix and be followed by a
!         piece of the message.  NWRAP is the number of characters per
!         piece; that is, after each NWRAP characters, we break and
!         start a new line.  In addition the characters '$$' embedded
!         in MESSG are a sentinel for a new line.  The counting of
!         characters up to NWRAP starts over for each new line.  The
!         value of NWRAP typically used by XERMSG is 72 since many
!         older error messages in the SLATEC Library are laid out to
!         rely on wrap-around every 72 characters.
!
! NWRAP   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This gives the maximum size
!         piece into which to break MESSG for printing on multiple
!         lines.  An embedded '$$' ends a line, and the count restarts
!         at the following character.  If a line break does not occur
!         on a blank (it would split a word) that word is moved to the
!         next line.  Values of NWRAP less than 16 will be treated as
!         16.  Values of NWRAP greater than 132 will be treated as 132.
!         The actual line length will be NPREF + NWRAP after NPREF has
!         been adjusted to fall between 0 and 16 and NWRAP has been
!         adjusted to fall between 16 and 132.

!           THE HANDLING OF THE NEW LINE SENTINEL TO BEHAVE LIKE THE

!   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
!           STREAMLINE THE CODING AND FIX A BUG THAT CAUSED EXTRA BLANK
!           LINES TO BE PRINTED.
!   890721  REVISED TO ADD A NEW FEATURE.  A NEGATIVE VALUE OF NPREF
!           CAUSES LEN(PREFIX) TO BE USED AS THE LENGTH.
!   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT ERROR IN CALCULATING PREFIX LENGTH.
!   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (WRB)
!   900510  Added code to break messages between words.  (RWC)

!
!     Description of Parameters
!      --Output--
!        IUNIT - an array of one to five unit numbers, depending

!                IUNIT(5) are not defined (for N .LT. 5) or altered
!                in any way by XGETUA.
!        N     - the number of units to which copies of the

!----------------------------------------------------------------------
! --- Biogenic compound estmates from BEIS and BEIS2 are put into 3
! --- broad categories - isoprene, monoterpenes, and other VOC's which
! --- include mainly low carbon olefins such as ethene, propene, etc.
! --- As a result- only monoterpenes are assumed to have the potential
! --- to form SOA. The monoterpene emissions are dominated by the emissions
! --- of pinenes, limonene, and myrcene (all are C10H16 in various stages
! --- of unsaturation) - myrcene is the most unsaturated being a triply
! --- unsaturated aliphatic hydorcabon.
!
! --- In this program we assume that monoterpenes are almost totally

!
! --- PURPOSE: Tabulates sigmas and rate of plume growth as function
!              of location within the wake from modified Weil (1996)
!              analytical expressions
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- V6.268-V6.269  100430  (DGS): Creat XWAKISC() and DRWAKISC()
!                                   arrays to align calculation of
!                                   plume drdx in wake region with
!                                   ISC-PRIME.
! --- V6.2-V6.268    100308  (DGS): Include BID in sigmas at xi and
!                                   allow these to grow linearly within
!                                   the wake PDF region.  Tabulated
!                                   sigmas for PRIME sources will now
!                                   include the BID.  Sigmas upwind of
!                                   of xi do not have BID at this point
!                                   and are flagged as negative.
!                    100308  (DGS): Fix bug in defining the entries in
!                                   the sigma arrays to conform to those
!                                   used in ISC-PRIME.  Change trap for
!                                   source located downwind of entry
!                                   wake.
!                    100308  (DGS): Add control to skip comparing wake
!                                   sigmas with ambient-growth sigmas to
!                                   conform to ISC-PRIME.
! --- V5.712-V6.2    070629  (DGS): Initialize dummy variables passed

!                D. Strimaitis
!
! --- PURPOSE:  Computes sampling step information in first timestep
!               for puffs/slugs released from sources with variable
!               release parameters.  The first sampling step is the
!               emitting step for this puff, with duration TEMIT.
!               Subsequent steps are consistent with parameters XMXLEN
!               and MXNEW until the last step, which is the residual
!               needed to close out the timestep.  
!
! --- UPDATE
! --- V6.24-V6.25    080227 (DGS): Replace MXSAM cap with MXNEW cap
!                                  Revise subroutine to include 3-part
!                                  sampling step structure
! --- V6.22-V6.24    080208 (DGS): Condition tsamp2 output to be equal
!                                  to temit when difference is less
!                                  than precision
! --- V6.1-V6.22     070921 (DGS): Impose MXSAM limit on NSAM result
! --- V6.0-V6.1      050915 (DGS): Remove emission step index (stored
!                                  in /PUFF/ now)

!
! --- PURPOSE: Adds the BID sigma to the wake sigmas upwind of the
! ---          entry to the wake.  WAKE_DFSN includes the BID in the
! ---          starting sigmas so this is carried in the resulting
! ---          wake tabulation from xi forward, but it is not in the
! ---          sigmas tabulated upwind of the entry to the wake.
! ---          These sigmas are tabulated as negatives.  WAKE_ADDBID
! ---          replaces all negative sigmas with the corresponding BID
! ---          enhanced sigmas.  Negative sign is retained and
! ---          is treated later in WAKE_XSIG and WAKE_TAB to add
! ---          constraint that linearly interpolated sigmas during rise
! ---          phase are at least as large as the BID sigmas.

! --- CALPUFF    Version: 7.3.1        Level: 150918            SPRAYS
!                C. DesAutels
!
! --- PURPOSE:  Initialize newly released puff/slug variables for
!               discrete SPRAY SOURCES with constant emissions.
!               This source type always emits slugs in the way that
!               puffs are emitted:  They do not extend continuously
!               from a point during the release step, with a new and
!               old end.  Rather, they are emitted as 'old' slugs at
!               the start of the release step, and both ends are the
!               same age and have the same properties.
